[[changes-since-early-draft-3]]
=== Changes Since Early Draft 3

* Added requirements on mapping @WebService-annotated Java classes to
WSDL.
* Removed references to the RMI classes that JAX-RPC 1.1 used to denote

* Added <<endpointif>> on the new Endpoint API.
* Added the following new annotation types: @RequestWrapper,
@ResponseWrapper, @WebServiceClient, @WebEndpoint.
* Added the createService(Class serviceInterface) method to
ServiceFactory.
* Renamed the Service.createPort method to Service.addPort.

runtime. In particular, the distinction between generated stubs and
dynamic proxies disappeared, and the spec now simply talks about
proxies.

mapping.

subsection.

subsection of this now contains much of the mterial from the JAX-RPC 1.1
Runtime Services chapter.
* Clarified that async methods are added to the regular sync SEI when
async mapping is enabled rather than to a separate async-only SEI, see
<<wsdl11asyncmethod>>.
* Added support for WSDL MIME binding, see section
<<wsdl11mimebindingmap>>.
* Clarified that fault mapping should only generate a single exception
for each equivalent set of faults, see <<faulttoexceptmap>>.
* Added property for message attachments.

style mapping (this doesn’t prevent substitution as orignally thought),
see <<wrappedstyle>>.

interfaces, see <<gensvcif>>.

<<mapextosoapfault>>.

<<handlerexecution>>.
* Added a section to clarify Stub use of RemoteException and
JAXRPCException, see <<stubexceptions>>.

and Server API chapters.
* Changes for context refactoring, removed message context properties
that previously held request/response contexts on client side, added
description of rules for moving between jaxws context and message
context boundaries.
* Removed requirement for Response.get to throw JAXRPCException, now
throws standard java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException instead.
* Added security API information.
* Clarrified SOAP mustUnderstand processing, see section
<<soapmuprocrules>>. Made it clear that the handler rather than the
HandlerInfo is authoritative wrt which protocol elements (e.g. SOAP
headers) it processes.
* Updated exception mapping for Java to WSDL since JAXB does not
envision mapping exception classes directly, see <<j2w11except>>.
