[[core-apis]]
== Core APIs

This chapter describes the standard core APIs that may be used by both
client and server side applications.

[[protocolbinding]]
=== jakarta.xml.ws.Binding

The `jakarta.xml.ws.Binding` interface acts as a base interface for Jakarta XML Web Services
protocol bindings. Bindings to specific protocols extend `Binding` and
may add methods to configure specific aspects of that protocol binding’s
operation. <<soapbindchap>> describes the Jakarta XML Web Services SOAP binding;
<<xmlbindchap>> describes the Jakarta XML Web Services XML/HTTP binding.

Applications obtain a `Binding` instance from a `BindingProvider` (a
proxy or `Dispatch` instance) or from an `Endpoint` using the
`getBinding` method (see <<bindingproviderif>>, <<endpointif>>).

A concrete binding is identified by a _binding id_, i.e. a URI. This
specification defines a number of standard bindings and their
corresponding identifiers (see <<soapbindchap>> and
<<xmlbindchap>>). Implementations MAY support additional bindings. In
order to minimize conflicts, the identifier for an
implementation-specific binding SHOULD use a URI scheme that includes a
domain name or equivalent, e.g. the "http" URI scheme. Such
identifiers SHOULD include a domain name controlled by the
implementation’s vendor.

`Binding` provides methods to manipulate the handler chain configured on
an instance (see <<handfmwrkprogconf>>).

&#9674; _Conformance (Read-only handler chains):_ An implementation MAY prevent changes to
handler chains configured by some other means (e.g. via a deployment
descriptor) by throwing `UnsupportedOperationException` from the
`setHandlerChain` method of `Binding`

[[spiprovider]]
=== jakarta.xml.ws.spi.Provider

`Provider` is an abstract service provider interface (SPI) factory class
that provides various methods for the creation of `Endpoint` instances
and `ServiceDelegate` instances. These methods are designed for use by
other Jakarta XML Web Services API classes, such as `Service` (see <<serviceapi>>) and
`Endpoint` (see <<endpointif>>) and are not intended to be called directly
by applications.

The `Provider` SPI allows an application to use a different Jakarta XML Web Services
implementation from the one bundled with the platform without any code
changes.

&#9674; __Conformance (Concrete __``__jakarta.xml.ws.spi.Provider__``__ required):__
An implementation MUST
provide a concrete class that extends `jakarta.xml.ws.spi.Provider`. Such
a class MUST have a public constructor which takes no arguments.

[[providerdiscovery]]
==== Configuration

The `Provider` implementation class is determined using the following
algorithm. The steps listed below are performed in sequence. At each
step, at most one candidate implementation class name will be produced.
The implementation will then attempt to load the class with the given
class name using the current context class loader or, if missing one,
the `java.lang.Class.forName(String)` method. As soon as a step results
in an implementation class being successfully loaded, the algorithm
terminates.

. If a system property with the name `jakarta.xml.ws.spi.Provider` is
defined, then its value is used as the name of the implementation class.
This phase of the look up enables per-JVM override
of the Jakarta XML Web Services implementation.
. Use the service-provider loading facilities, defined by the
`java.util.ServiceLoader` class, to attempt to locate and load an
implementation of `jakarta.xml.ws.spi.Provider` service using the default
loading mechanism .
. Finally, if all the steps above fail, then the rest of the lookup is unspecified.
That said, the recommended behavior is to simply look for some hard-coded platform
default Jakarta XML Web Services implementation. This phase of the lookup is
so that the environment can have its own Jakarta XML Web Services implementation as the last resort.

[[providerendpointcreation]]
==== Creating Endpoint Objects

Endpoints can be created using the following methods on `Provider`:

`*createEndpoint(String bindingID, Object implementor)*`::
Creates and
returns an `Endpoint` for the specified binding and implementor. If the
`bindingId is` `null` and no binding information is specified via the
`jakarta.xml.ws.BindingType` annotation then a default SOAP1.1/HTTP
binding MUST be used.

`*createEndpoint(String bindingID, Object implementor, WebServiceFeature ... features)*`::
Same as the above `createEndpoint()` method. The created `Endpoint` is
configured with the web service features.

`*createAndPublishEndpoint(String address, Object implementor)*`::
Creates
and publishes an `Endpoint` for the given implementor. The binding is
chosen by default based on the URL scheme of the provided address (which
must be a URL). If a suitable binding if found, the endpoint is created
then published as if the `Endpoint.publish(String address)` method had
been called. The created `Endpoint` is then returned as the value of the
method.

`*createAndPublishEndpoint(String address, Object implementor, WebServiceFeature ... features)*`::
Same as the above `createAndPublishEndpoint()` method. The created
`Endpoint` is configured with the web service features.

`*createEndpoint(String bindingId, Class<?> implementorClass, Invoker invoker, WebServiceFeature ... features)*`::
Creates an Endpoint for the implementor class and the endpoint
invocation is handled by the `Invoker`. If the bindingId is null and no
binding information is specified via the `jakarta.xml.ws.BindingType`
annotation then a default SOAP1.1/HTTP binding MUST be used. The created
`Endpoint` is configured with the web service features.

An implementor object MUST be either:

* an instance of a SEI-based endpoint class, i.e. a class annotated with
the `@WebService` annotation according to the rules in <<j2wsdl11chap>>, or
* an instance of a provider class, i.e. a class implementing the
`Provider` interface and annotated with the `@WebServiceProvider`
annotation according to the rules in <<providersvcapi>>.

The `createAndPublishEndpoint(String,Object)` method is provided as a
shortcut for the common operation of creating and publishing an
`Endpoint`. It corresponds to the static `publish` method defined on the
`Endpoint` class, see <<endpointfactusage>>.

&#9674; _Conformance (Provider createAndPublishEndpoint Method):_ The effect of invoking the
`createAndPublishEndpoint` method on a `Provider` MUST be the same as
first invoking the `createEndpoint` method with the binding ID
appropriate to the URL scheme used by the address, then invoking the
`publish(String address)` method on the resulting `endpoint`.

[[providerservicedelegatecreation]]
==== Creating ServiceDelegate Objects

`jakarta.xml.ws.spi.ServiceDelegate` <<coresvcdelegate>> can be created
using the following methods on `Provider`:

`*createServiceDelegate(URL wsdlDocumentLocation, QName serviceName, Class <? extends Service> serviceClass)*`::
Creates and returns a `ServiceDelegate` for the specified service. When
starting from WSDL the serviceClass will be the generated service class
as described in <<gensvcif>>. In the dynamic case where there is
no service class generated it will be `jakarta.xml.ws.Service`. The
serviceClass is used by the `ServiceDelegate` to get access to the
annotations.

`*createServiceDelegate(URL wsdlDocumentLocation, QName serviceName, Class <? extends Service> serviceClass, WebServiceFeature ... features)*`::
Same as the above `createServiceDelegate()` method and it also
configures the delegate with all the web service features.

[[readepr]]
==== EndpointReferences

The `Provider` class provides the following methods to create
`EndpointReference` instances.

`*readEndpointReference(javax.xml.transform.Source source)*`::
Unmarshalls and returns a `jakarta.xml.ws.EndpointReference`
from the infoset contained in `source`.

`*createW3CEndpointReference(String address, QName serviceName, QName portName, List<Element> metadata, String wsdlDocumentLocation, List<Element> referenceParameters)*`::
Creates a `W3CEndpointReference` using
the specified `String address`, `QName serviceName`, `QName portName`,
`List<Element> metadata`, `String wsdlDocumentLocation`, and
`List<Element> referenceParameters` parameters.

`*createW3CEndpointReference(String address, QName interfaceName, QName serviceName, QName portName, List<Element> metadata, String wsdlDocumentLocation, List<Element> referenceParameters, List<Element> elements, Map<QName, String> attributes)*`::
Creates W3CEndpointReference using the specified parameters. This method
adds support for extension elements, extension attributes, and porttype
name.

[[getport]]
==== Getting Port Objects

The following method can be used to get a proxy for a Port.

`*getPort(EndpointReference epr, Class<T> sei, WebServiceFeature... features)*`::
Gets a proxy for the `sei` that can be used to invoke operations on
the endpoint referred to by the `epr`. The specified `features` MUST
be enabled/disabled and configured as specified. The returned proxy
MUST use the `epr` to determine the endpoint address and any reference
parameters that MUST be sent on endpoint invocations. The `epr` MUST
NOT be used directly as the value of an WS-Addressing header such as
`wsa:ReplyTo`.

[[coresvcdelegate]]
=== jakarta.xml.ws.spi.ServiceDelegate

The `jakarta.xml.ws.spi.ServiceDelegate` class is an abstract class that
implementations MUST provide. This is the class that
`jakarta.xml.ws.Service` <<serviceapi>> class delegates all methods, except
the static `create` methods to. ServiceDelegate is defined as an
abstract class for future extensibility purpose.

&#9674; __Conformance (Concrete __``__jakarta.xml.ws.spi.ServiceDelegate__``__ required):__
An implementation MUST provide a concrete class that extends
`jakarta.xml.ws.spi.ServiceDelegate`.

[[coreexceptions]]
=== Exceptions

The following standard exceptions are defined by Jakarta XML Web Services.

`*jakarta.xml.ws.WebServiceException*`::
A runtime exception that is thrown by methods in Jakarta XML Web Services APIs when
errors occur during local processing.
`*jakarta.xml.ws.ProtocolException*`::
A base class for exceptions related to a specific protocol binding.
Subclasses are used to communicate protocol level fault information to
clients and may be used by a service implementation to control the
protocol specific fault representation.
`*jakarta.xml.ws.soap.SOAPFaultException*`::
A subclass of `ProtocolException`, may be used to carry SOAP specific
information.
`*jakarta.xml.ws.http.HTTPException*`::
A subclass of `ProtocolException`, may be used to carry HTTP specific
information.

[NOTE]
.Editors Note
====
_A future version of this specification may introduce a new exception
class to distinguish errors due to client misconfiguration or
inappropriate parameters being passed to an API from errors that were
generated locally on the sender node as part of the invocation process
(e.g. a broken connection or an unresolvable server name). Currently,
both kinds of errors are mapped to WebServiceException, but the latter
kind would be more usefully mapped to its own exception type, much like
ProtocolException is._
====

[[protocolspecificfaults]]
==== Protocol Specific Exception Handling

&#9674; _Conformance (Protocol specific fault generation):_ When throwing an exception as the
result of a protocol level fault, an implementation MUST ensure that the
exception is an instance of the appropriate `ProtocolException`
subclass. For SOAP the appropriate `ProtocolException` subclass is
`SOAPFaultException`, for XML/HTTP is is `HTTPException`.

&#9674; _Conformance (Protocol specific fault consumption):_ When an implementation catches an
exception thrown by a service endpoint implementation and the cause of
that exception is an instance of the appropriate `ProtocolException`
subclass for the protocol in use, an implementation MUST reflect the
information contained in the `ProtocolException` subclass within the
generated protocol level fault.

[[client-side-example]]
===== Client Side Example

[source,java,numbered]
-------------
try {
    response = dispatch.invoke(request);
} catch (SOAPFaultException e) {
    QName soapFaultCode = e.getFault().getFaultCodeAsQName();
    ...
}
-------------

[[server-side-example]]
===== Server Side Example

[source,java,numbered]
-------------
public void endpointOperation() {
    ...
    if (someProblem) {
        SOAPFault fault = soapBinding.getSOAPFactory().createFault(
            faultcode, faultstring, faultactor, detail);
        throw new SOAPFaultException(fault);
    }
    ...
}
-------------

[[onewayoperationexception]]
===== One-way Operations

&#9674; _Conformance (One-way operations):_ When sending a one-way message, implementations
MUST throw a `WebServiceException` if any error is detected when sending
the message.

[[webservicefeature]]
=== jakarta.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature

Jakarta XML Web Services introduces the notion of features. A feature is associated
with a particular functionality or behavior. Some features may only have
meaning when used with certain bindings while other features may be
generally useful. These features can be used while creating service
and proxy instances. Jakarta XML Web Services introduces three
standard features for creating proxy instances, `AddressingFeature`,
`MTOMFeature` and `RespectBindingFeature` as well as the base
`WebServiceFeature` class. There are no standard features for service
creation in the current specification. A Jakarta XML Web Services
implementation may define its own features but they will be non-portable
across all Jakarta XML Web Services implementations.

Each feature is derived from the `jakarta.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature` class.
This allows the web service developer to pass different types of
`WebServiceFeatures` to the various Jakarta XML Web Services APIs that utilize them. Also,
each feature should be documented using JavaDocs on the derived classes.
Each `WebServiceFeature` MUST have a `public static final String ID`
field that is used to uniquely identify the feature.

&#9674; __Conformance (__``__jakarta.xml.ws.WebServiceFeatures__``__):__
Each derived type of
`jakarta.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature` MUST contain a
`public static final String ID` field that uniquely identifies the
feature against all features of all implementations.

Since vendors can specify their own features, care MUST be taken when
creating a feature ID so as to not conflict with another vendor’s ID.

The `WebServiceFeature` class also has an `enabled` property that is
used to store whether a particular feature should be enabled or
disabled. Each derived type should provide either a constructor argument
and/or a method that will allow the web service developer to set the
`enabled` property. The meaning of enabled or disabled is determined by
each individual `WebServiceFeature`. It is important that web services
developers be able to enable/disable specific features when writing
their web applications. For example, a developer may choose to implement
WS-Addressing himself while using the Dispatch and Provider APIs and
thus he MUST be able to tell Jakarta XML Web Services to disable addressing.

&#9674; __Conformance (__``__enabled__``__ property):__
Each derived type of
`jakarta.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature` MUST provide a constructor argument
and/or method to allow the web service developer to set the value of the
`enabled` property. The public default constructor MUST by default set
the `enabled` property to `true`. An implementation MUST honor the value
of the `enabled` property of any supported `WebServiceFeature`.

[[addressingfeature]]
==== jakarta.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature

The `AddressingFeature` is used to control the use of
WS-Addressing<<bib26>> by Jakarta XML Web Services. This feature MUST be
supported with the SOAP 1.1/HTTP or SOAP 1.2/HTTP bindings. Using this
feature with any other binding is undefined. This feature corresponds to
the Addressing annotation described in <<addrannotation>>.

Enabling this feature on the server will result in the runtime being
capable of consuming and responding to WS-Addressing headers.

Enabling this feature on the client will cause the Jakarta
XML Web Services runtime to include WS-Addressing headers
in SOAP messages as specified by WS-Addressing<<bib26>>.

Disabling this feature will prevent a Jakarta XML Web Services runtime from processing or
adding WS-Addressing headers from/to SOAP messages even if the
associated WSDL specifies otherwise. This may be necessary if a client
or endpoint needs to implement Addressing themselves. For example, a
client that desires to use non-anonymous ReplyTo can do so by disabling
the `AddressingFeature` and by using `Dispatch<Source>` with `Message`
mode.

The `AddressingFeature`’s `required` property can be configured to
control whether all incoming messages MUST contain Addressing headers.

The `AddressingFeature`’s `responses` property can be configured to
control whether the endpoint requires the use of anonymous,
non-anonymous and all responses.

This feature is automatically enabled if the WSDL indicates the use of
addressing as per the WS-Addressing 1.0 - Metadata<<bib27>>.
Developers may choose to prevent this from happening by explicitly
disabling the `AddressingFeature`.

[[epr6]]
===== jakarta.xml.ws.EndpointReference

The abstract `EndpointReference` class is used by the Jakarta XML Web Services APIs to
reference a particular endpoint in accordance with the W3C Web Services
Addressing 1.0<<bib26>>. Each concrete instance of an
`EndpointReference` MUST contain a `wsa:Address`.

Applications may also use the `EndpointReference` class in method
signatures. Jakarta XML Binding will bind the `EndpointReference` base class to
`xs:anyType`. Applications should instead use concrete implementations
of `EndpointReference` such as `jakarta.xml.ws.W3CEndpointReference` which
will provide better binding. Jakarta XML Web Services implementations are required to
support the `W3CEndpointReference` class but they may also provide other
`EndpointReference` subclasses that represent different versions of
Addressing.

[[w3cepr]]
===== jakarta.xml.ws.W3CEndpointReference

The `W3CEndpointReference` class is a concrete implementation of the
`jakarta.xml.ws.EndpointReference` class and is used to reference
endpoints that are compliant with the W3C Web Services Addressing 1.0 -
Core<<bib26>> recommendation. Applications may use this
class to pass `EndpointReference` instances as method parameters or
return types. Jakarta XML Binding will bind the `W3CEndpointReference` class to the
W3C EndpointReference XML Schema in the WSDL.

[[mtomfeature]]
==== jakarta.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature

The `MTOMFeature` is used to specify if MTOM should be used with a web
service. This feature should be used instead of the
`jakarta.xml.ws.soap.SOAPBinding.SOAP11HTTP_MTOM_BINDING`,
`jakarta.xml.ws.soap.SOAPBinding.SOAP12HTTP_MTOM_BINDING` and the
`jakarta.xml.ws.soap.SOAPBinding.setMTOMEnabled()`. This feature MUST be
supported with the SOAP 1.1/HTTP or SOAP 1.2/HTTP bindings. Using this
feature with any other bindings is undefined. This feature corresponds
to the `MTOM` annotation described in <<mtomannotation>>.

Enabling this feature on either the server or client will result the
Jakarta XML Web Services runtime using MTOM and for binary data being sent as an
attachment.

The `MTOMFeature` has one property `threshold`, that can be configured to
serve as a hint for which binary data SHOULD be sent as an attachment.
The `threshold` is the size in bytes that binary data SHOULD be in order
to be sent as an attachment. The `threshold` MUST not be negative. The
default value is `0`.

&#9674; __Conformance (__``__jakarta.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature__``__):__
An implementation MUST support the
`jakarta.xml.ws.soap.MTOMFeature` and its `threshold` property.

[[respbindfeature]]
==== jakarta.xml.ws.RespectBindingFeature

The `RespectBindingFeature` is used to control whether a Jakarta XML Web Services
implementation MUST respect/honor the contents of the `wsdl:binding`
associated with an endpoint. It has a corresponding `RespectBinding`
annotation described in <<respbindingannotation>>.

&#9674; __Conformance (__``__jakarta.xml.ws.RespectBindingFeature__``__):__
When the `jakarta.xml.ws.RespectBindingFeature` is enabled,
a Jakarta XML Web Services implementation
MUST inspect the `wsdl:binding` at runtime to determine result and
parameter bindings as well as any `wsdl:extensions` that have the
`required="true"` attribute. All required `wsdl:extensions` MUST be
supported and honored by a Jakarta XML Web Services implementation unless a specific
`wsdl:extension` has be explicitly disabled via a `WebServiceFeature`.

When this feature is enabled, a Jakarta XML Web Services implementation must support and
honor the addressing policy, if specified, in the WSDL. However, such
addressing requirements can be explicitly disabled via
`AddressingFeature`.

In order to not break backward compatibility with JAX-WS 2.0, the
behavior with regards to respecting the `wsdl:binding` when this feature
is disabled is undefined.

[[httpspi]]
=== jakarta.xml.ws.spi.http (HTTP SPI)

The classes in this package can be used for a portable deployment of
Jakarta XML Web Services web services in a HTTP container (for example, servlet container).
This SPI enables to decouple the Jakarta XML Web Services deployment and runtime and is
not meant for end developers but for container or its extension
developers.

The HTTP SPI allows a deployment to use any available web services
runtime for HTTP transport.

The HTTP SPI consists of the following classes:

`*jakarta.xml.ws.spi.http.HttpContext*`::
`HttpContext` represents a mapping between the root URI path of a web
service to a `HttpHandler` which is invoked to handle requests
destined for that path on the associated container.
`*jakarta.xml.ws.spi.http.HttpExchange*`::
This class encapsulates a HTTP request received and a response to be
generated in one exchange.
`*jakarta.xml.ws.spi.http.HttpHandler*`::
A handler which is invoked to process HTTP exchanges.
`*jakarta.xml.ws.spi.Invoker*`::
`Invoker` hides the detail of calling into application endpoint
implementation.

Typical portable deployment is done as below:

. Container creates Endpoint objects for an application. The necessary
information to create `Endpoint` objects may be got from web service
deployment descriptor files.
. Container creates `HttpContext` objects for the deployment. For
example, a `HttpContext` could be created using servlet
configuration(for e.g. url-pattern) for a web service in servlet
container case.
. Then publishes all the endpoints using
`Endpoint.publish(HttpContext)`. During `publish()`, Jakarta XML Web Services runtime
registers a `HttpHandler` callback to handle incoming requests or
`HttpExchange` objects. The `HttpExchange` object encapsulates HTTP
request and response.

....
  Container                               Jakarta XML Web Services runtime
  ---------                               --------------
  1. Creates Invoker1, ... InvokerN
  2. Provider.createEndpoint(...)     --> 3. creates Endpoint1
     configures Endpoint1
     ...
  4. Provider.createEndpoint(...)     --> 5. creates EndpointN
     configures EndpointN
  6. Creates EndpointContext with
     Endpoint1, ..., EndpointN
     and sets it on all endpoints.
  7. creates HttpContext1, ... HttpContextN
  8. Endpoint1.publish(HttpContext1)  --> 9. creates HttpHandler1
                                          HttpContext1.setHandler(HttpHandler1)
     ...
 10. EndpointN.publish(HttpContextN)  --> 11. creates HttpHandlerN
                                          HttpContextN.setHandler(HttpHandlerN)
....

Typical request processing is done as below(for every request):

....
  Container                               Jakarta XML Web Services runtime
  ---------                               --------------
  1. Creates a HttpExchange
  2. Gets handler from HttpContext
  3. HttpHandler.handle(HttpExchange) --> 4. reads request from HttpExchange
                                      <-- 5. Calls Invoker
  6. Invokes the actual instance
                                          7. Writes the response to HttpExchange
....

Typical portable undeployment is done as below:

....
  Container                               Jakarta XML Web Services runtime
  ---------                               --------------
  1. @preDestroy on instances
  2. Endpoint1.stop()
  ...
  3. EndpointN.stop()
....
