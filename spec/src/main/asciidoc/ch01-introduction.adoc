[[introduction]]
== Introduction

XML<<bib1>> is a platform-independent means of representing
structured information. XML Web Services use XML as the basis for
communication between Web-based services and clients of those services
and inherit XML’s platform independence. SOAP<<bib2>><<bib3>><<bib4>>
describes one such XML based message format and "defines, using XML
technologies, an extensible messaging framework containing a message
construct that can be exchanged over a variety of underlying
protocols."

WSDL<<bib5>> is "an XML format for describing network
services as a set of endpoints operating on messages containing either
document-oriented or procedure-oriented information." WSDL can be
considered the de-facto service description language for XML Web
Services.

JAX-RPC 1.0<<bib6>> defined APIs and conventions for supporting RPC
oriented XML Web Services in the Java platform. Jakarta XML RPC<<bib7>> added
support for the WS-I Basic Profile 1.0<<bib8>> to improve interoperability between
Jakarta XML RPC implementations and with services implemented using other technologies.

Jakarta Web Services Metadata defines the syntax and semantics of Java Web Service
(JWS) metadata and default values and implementers are expected to provide tools that map the
annotated Java classes onto a specific runtime environment.

Jakarta XML Web Services (this specification) is a follow-on to Jakarta XML RPC,
extending it as described in the following sections.

Throughout the document, references to JAXB refer to the Jakarta XML Binding
unless otherwise noted and references to JAX-WS refer to the Jakarta XML Web
Services unless otherwise noted.

[[goals]]
=== Goals

Since the release of JAX-RPC 1.0<<bib6>>, new specifications and
new versions of the standards it depends on have been released.
Jakarta XML Web Services relates to these specifications
and standards as follows:

Jakarta Web Services Metadata::

* Define an annotated Java syntax for programming Web Service
applications.
* Provide a simplified model for Web Service development that facilitates
and accelerates development.
* Provide a syntax that is amenable to manipulation by tools.
* Define a standard for to building and deploying Web Services without
requiring knowledge and implementation of generalized APIs and
deployment descriptors.

This specification addresses the need to simplify:

* Development of server applications that conform both to basic SOAP and
WSDL standards.
* Building Web Services that can be deployed with the core Web Services
APIs and existing Jakarta EE standards.
* Separate control of public Web Service message contracts and private
implementation signatures, because in practice public and private
formats evolve on different schedules.


Jakarta XML Binding::
Due primarily to scheduling concerns, JAX-RPC 1.0 defined its own data
binding facilities. With the release of JAXB 1.0 <<bib9>>
there is no reason to maintain two separate sets of XML mapping
rules in the Java platform. Jakarta XML Web Services will delegate data
binding-related tasks to the Jakarta XML Binding<<bib39>>
specification that is being developed in parallel with Jakarta XML Web Services. +
Jakarta XML Binding<<bib39>> will add support for Java to XML
mapping, additional support for less used XML schema constructs, and
provide bidirectional customization of Java
&#x21d4; XML data binding. Jakarta XML Web Services will allow
full use of JAXB provided facilities including binding customization
and optional schema validation.
* JAX-WS 2.1 requires JAXB 2.1<<bib11>>.
* JAX-WS 2.2 requires JAXB 2.2<<bib12>>.
* JAX-WS 2.3 requires JAXB 2.3<<bib13>>.
* Jakarta XML Web Services 3.0 requires Jakarta XML Binding 3.0<<bib39>>.

SOAP 1.2::
Whilst SOAP 1.1 is still widely deployed, it’s expected that services
will migrate to SOAP 1.2<<bib3>><<bib4>>
now that it is a W3C Recommendation.
Jakarta XML Web Services will add support for SOAP 1.2 whilst
requiring continued support for SOAP 1.1.

WSDL 2.0::
The W3C is expected to progress WSDL 2.0<<bib14>> to
Recommendation during the lifetime of this JSR. Jakarta XML Web Services
will add support for WSDL 2.0 whilst requiring continued support for WSDL 1.1.
[NOTE]
.Note
====
_The expert group decided against this goal for this
release. We will look at adding support in a future revision of the
Jakarta XML Web Services specification._
====

WS-I Basic Profile 1.1::
Jakarta XML RPC added support for WS-I Basic Profile 1.0. WS-I Basic
Profile 1.1 is expected to supersede 1.0 during the lifetime of this
specificatoin and Jakarta XML Web Services will add support
for the additional clarifications it provides.

A Metadata Facility for the Java Programming Language (JSR 175)::
Jakarta XML Web Services will define the use of Java annotations<<bib15>> to
simplify the most common development scenarios for both clients and
servers.

Jakarta XML Web Services Metadata::
Jakarta XML Web Services will align with and complement the annotations defined by
Jakarta XML Web Services Metadata<<bib16>>.

Jakarta Enterprise Web Services::
The Jakarta Enterprise Web Services specification<<bib17>>
defined `jaxrpc-mapping-info`
deployment descriptor provides deployment time Java
&#x21d4; WSDL mapping functionality. In
conjunction with Jakarta Enterprise Web Services Metadata<<bib16>>,
Jakarta Enterprise Web Services will complement this
mapping functionality with development time Java annotations that
control Java &#x21d4; WSDL mapping.

Web Services Security (JSR 183)::
Jakarta XML Web Services will align with and complement the security APIs
defined by JSR 183<<bib18>>.

Jakarta XML Web Services will improve support for document/message centric usage:

Asynchrony::
Jakarta XML Web Services will add support for client side asynchronous operations.

Non-HTTP Transports::
Jakarta XML Web Services will improve the separation between the XML message
format and the underlying transport mechanism to simplify use of Jakarta XML
Web Services with non-HTTP transports.

Message Access::
Jakarta XML Web Services will simplify client and service access
to the messages underlying an exchange.

Session Management::
Jakarta XML RPC session management capabilities are tied to HTTP. Jakarta
XML Web Services will add support for message based session management.

Jakarta XML Web Services will also address issues that have arisen
with experience of implementing and using JAX-RPC 1.0:

Handlers::
Jakarta XML Web Services will simplify the development of handlers and
will provide a mechanism to allow handlers to collaborate with service
clients and service endpoint implementations.

Versioning and Evolution of Web Services::
Jakarta XML Web Services will describe techniques and mechanisms to ease
the burden on developers when creating new versions of existing services.

[[nongoals20]]
=== Non-Goals

The following are non-goals:

Backwards Compatibility of Binary Artifacts::
Binary compatibility between Jakarta XML RPC and Jakarta XML Web Services
implementation runtimes.

Pluggable data binding::
Jakarta XML Web Services will defer data binding to Jakarta XML Binding<<bib39>>;
it is not a goal to provide a plug-in API to allow other types of data
binding technologies to be used in place of Jakarta XML Binding. However,
Jakarta XML Web Services will maintain the capability to selectively disable
data binding to provide an XML based fragment suitable for use as input to
alternative data binding technologies.

SOAP Encoding Support::
Use of the SOAP encoding is essentially deprecated in the web services
community, e.g., the WS-I Basic Profile<<bib8>> excludes SOAP encoding. Instead,
literal usage is  preferred, either in the RPC or document style. +
 +
SOAP 1.1 encoding is supported in JAX-RPC 1.0 and Jakarta XML RPC but its support
in Jakarta XML Web Services runs counter to the goal of delegation of
data binding to Jakarta XML Binding. Therefore Jakarta XML Web Services
will make support for SOAP 1.1 encoding optional and defer description of
it to Jakarta XML RPC. +
 +
Support for the SOAP 1.2 Encoding<<bib4>>
is optional in SOAP 1.2 and Jakarta XML Web Services will not add
support for SOAP 1.2 encoding.

Backwards Compatibility of Generated Artifacts::
JAX-RPC 1.0 and JAXB 1.0 bind XML to Java in different ways.
Generating source code that works with unmodified Jakarta XML RPC client
source code is not a goal.

Support for Java versions prior to Java SE 5.0::
Jakarta XML Web Services relies on many of the Java language features
added in Java SE 5.0. It is not a goal to support Jakarta XML Web
Services on Java versions prior to Java SE 5.0.

Service Registration and Discovery::
It is not a goal of Jakarta XML Web Services to describe registration
and discovery of services via UDDI or ebXML RR. This capability is
provided independently by Jakarta XML Registries<<bib19>>.

[[requirements]]
=== Requirements

[[relationship-to-jaxb]]
==== Relationship To Jakarta XML Binding

Jakarta XML Web Services specification describes the WSDL &#x21d4; Java mapping,
but data binding is delegated to Jakarta XML Binding<<bib39>>. The
specification must clearly designate where Jakarta XML Binding rules
apply to the WSDL &#x21d4; Java mapping without reproducing those
rules and must describe how Jakarta XML Binding capabilities (e.g.,
the Jakarta XML Binding binding language) are incorporated into
Jakarta XML Web Services. Jakarta XML Web Services is required to be able to
influence the Jakarta XML Binding binding, e.g., to avoid name collisions and to be
able to control schema validation on serialization and deserialization.

[[standardized-wsdl-mapping]]
==== Standardized WSDL Mapping

WSDL is the de-facto service description language for XML Web Services.
The specification must specify a standard WSDL
&#x21d4; Java mapping. The following versions of
WSDL must be supported:

* WSDL 1.1<<bib5>> as clarified by the WS-I Basic
Profile(Ballinger, Ehnebuske, Gudgin, et al. 2004; Ballinger, Ehnebuske,
Ferris, et al. 2004)

The standardized WSDL mapping will describe the default WSDL
&#x21d4; Java mapping. The default mapping may be
overridden using customizations as described below.

[[customizable-wsdl-mapping]]
==== Customizable WSDL Mapping

The specification must provide a standard way to customize the WSDL
&#x21d4; Java mapping. The following customization
methods will be specified:

Java Annotations::
In conjunction with Jakarta XML Binding<<bib39>> and Jakarta XML
Web Services Metadata<<bib16>> specifications,
the specification will define a set of standard annotations
that may be used in Java source files to specify the mapping from Java
artifacts to their associated WSDL components. The annotations will
support mapping to WSDL 1.1.

WSDL Annotations::
In conjunction with Jakarta XML Binding<<bib39>> and Jakarta XML
Web Services Metadata<<bib16>> specifications,
the specification will define a set of standard annotations
that may be used either within WSDL documents or as in an external
form to specify the mapping from WSDL components to their associated
Java artifacts. The annotations will support mapping from WSDL 1.1.

The specification must describe the precedence rules governing
combinations of the customization methods.

[[standardized-protocol-bindings]]
==== Standardized Protocol Bindings

The specification must describe standard bindings to the following
protocols:

* SOAP 1.1<<bib2>> as clarified by the WS-I Basic Profile<<bib8>><<bib20>>
* SOAP 1.2<<bib3>><<bib4>>

The specification must not prevent non-standard bindings to other
protocols.

[[standardized-transport-bindings]]
==== Standardized Transport Bindings

The specification must describe standard bindings to the following
protocols:

* HTTP/1.1<<bib21>>.

The specification must not prevent non-standard bindings to other
transports.

[[standardized-handler-framework]]
==== Standardized Handler Framework

The specification must include a standardized handler framework that
describes:

Data binding for handlers::
The framework will offer data binding facilities to handlers and will
support handlers that are decoupled from the Jakarta SOAP with Attachments API.

Handler Context::
The framework will describe a mechanism for communicating properties
between handlers and the associated service clients and service
endpoint implementations.

Unified Response and Fault Handling::
The `handleResponse` and `handleFault` methods will be unified and the
the declarative model for handlers will be improved.

[[versioning-and-evolution]]
==== Versioning and Evolution

The specification must describe techniques and mechanisms to support
versioning of service endpoint interfaces. The facilities must allow new
versions of an interface to be deployed whilst maintaining compatibility
for existing clients.

[[standardized-synchronous-and-asynchronous-invocation]]
==== Standardized Synchronous and Asynchronous Invocation

There must be a detailed description of the generated method signatures
to support both asynchronous and synchronous method invocation in stubs
generated by Jakarta XML Web Services. Both forms of invocation will
support a user configurable timeout period.

[[session-management]]
==== Session Management

The specification must describe a standard session management mechanism
including:

Session APIs::
Definition of a session interface and methods to obtain the session
interface and initiate sessions for handlers and service endpoint
implementations.

HTTP based sessions::
The session management mechanism must support HTTP cookies and URL
rewriting.

SOAP based sessions::
The session management mechanism must support SOAP based session
information.

[[use-cases]]
=== Use Cases
