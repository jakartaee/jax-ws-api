== Customizations

This chapter describes a standard customization facility that can be
used to customize the WSDL 1.1 to Java binding defined in section
<<wsdl112java>>.

[[bindinglanguage]]
=== Binding Language

Jakarta XML Web Services defines an XML-based language that can be used to specify
customizations to the WSDL 1.1 to Java binding. In order to maintain
consistency with Jakarta XML Binding, we call it a __binding language__. Similarly,
customizations will hereafter be referred to as __binding
declarations__.

All XML elements defined in this section belong to the
`https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxws` namespace. For clarity, the rest of
this section uses qualified element names exclusively. Wherever it
appears, the `jaxws` prefix is assumed to be bound to the
`https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxws` namespace name.

The binding language is extensible. Extensions are expressed using
elements and/or attributes whose namespace name is different from the
one used by this specification.

&#9674; _Conformance (Standard binding declarations):_
The `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxws`
namespace is reserved for standard Jakarta XML Web Services binding declarations.
Implementations MUST support all standard Jakarta XML Web Services binding declarations.
Implementation-specific binding declaration extensions MUST NOT use the
`https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxws` namespace.

&#9674; _Conformance (Binding language extensibility):_
Implementations MUST ignore unknown
elements and attributes appearing inside a binding declaration whose
namespace name is not the one specified in the standard, i.e.
`https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxws`.

[[bindingdeclarationcontainer]]
=== Binding Declaration Container

There are two ways to specify binding declarations. In the first
approach, all binding declarations pertaining to a given WSDL document
are grouped together in a standalone document, called an _external
binding file_ (see <<externalbindingfile>>). The second approach consists
in embeddeding binding declarations directly inside a WSDL document (see
<<embeddedbindingdeclarations>>).

In either case, the `jaxws:bindings` element is used as a container for
Jakarta XML Web Services binding declarations. It contains a (possibly
empty) list of binding declarations, in any order.

[id="8.1"]
.Syntax of the binding declaration container
[source,xml,numbered]
-------------
<jaxws:bindings wsdlLocation="xs:anyURI"?
                node="xs:string"?
                version="string"?>
  ...binding declarations...
</jaxws:bindings>
-------------

*Semantics*

@wsdlLocation::
A URI pointing to a WSDL file establishing the scope of the contents
of this binding declaration. It MUST NOT be present if the
`jaxws:bindings` element is used as an extension inside a WSDL
document or one of its ancestor `jaxws:bindings` elements already
contains this attribute.
@node::
An XPath expression pointing to the element in the WSDL file in scope
that this binding declaration is attached to. It MUST NOT be present
if the `jaxws:bindings` appears inside a WSDL document.
@version::
A version identifier. It MUST NOT appear on `jaxws:bindings` elements
which have any `jaxws:bindings` ancestors (i.e. on non top-level
binding declarations).

For the Jakarta XML Web Services specification, the version identifier, if present,
MUST be `3.0`. If the `@version` attribute is absent, it will implicitly
be assumed to be `3.0`.

[[embeddedbindingdeclarations]]
=== Embedded Binding Declarations

An embedded binding declaration is specified by using the
`jaxws:bindings` element as a WSDL extension. Embedded binding
declarations MAY appear on any of the elements in the WSDL 1.1 namespace
that accept extension elements, per the schema for the WSDL 1.1
namespace as amended by the WS-I Basic Profile 1.1<<bib20>>.

A binding declaration embedded in a WSDL document can only affect the
WSDL element it extends. When a `jaxws:bindings` element is used as a
WSDL extension, it MUST NOT have a `node` attribute. Moreover, it MUST
NOT have an element whose qualified name is `jaxws:bindings` amongs its
children.

[[embeddedbindingdeclarationsex]]
==== Example

Figure <<8.2>> shows a WSDL document containing binding declaration
extensions. For Jakarta XML Binding annotations, it assumes that
the prefix `jaxb` is bound to the namespace name `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxb`.

</wsdl:definitions>

[[externalbindingfile]]
=== External Binding File

The `jaxws:bindings` element MAY appear as the root element of a XML
document. Such a document is called an __external binding file__.

An external binding file specifies bindings for a given WSDL document.
The WSDL document in question is identified via the mandatory
`wsdlLocation` attribute on the root `jaxws:bindings` element in the
document.

In an external binding file, `jaxws:bindings` elements MAY appear as
non-root elements, e.g. as a child or descendant of the root
`jaxws:bindings` element. In this case, they MUST carry a `node`
attribute identifying the element in the WSDL document they annotate.
The root `jaxws:bindings` element implicitly contains a `node` attribute
whose value is `//`, i.e. selecting the root element in the document. An
XPath expression on a non-root `jaxws:bindings` element selects zero or
more nodes from the set of nodes selected by its parent `jaxws:bindings`
element.

External binding files are semantically equivalent to embedded binding
declarations (see <<embeddedbindingdeclarations>>). When a Jakarta XML Web Services
implementation processes a WSDL document for which there is an external
binding file, it MUST operate as if all binding declarations specified
in the external binding file were instead specified as embedded
declarations on the nodes in the in the WSDL document they target. It is
an error if, upon embedding the binding declarations defined in one or
more external binding files, the resulting WSDL document contains
conflicting binding declarations.

&#9674; _Conformance (Multiple binding files):_ Implementations MUST support specifying any
number of external Jakarta XML Web Services and Jakarta XML Binding binding files for processing in
conjunction with at least one WSDL document.

Please refer to <<jaxbbindingdeclarations>> for more information
on processing Jakarta XML Binding binding declarations.

[[jaxbbindingdeclarations]]
=== Using Jakarta XML Binding Binding Declarations

It is possible to use Jakarta XML Binding binding declarations in conjunction with
Jakarta XML Web Services.

The Jakarta XML Binding bindings element, henceforth referred to as
`jaxb:bindings`, MAY appear as an annotation inside a schema document
embedded in a WSDL document, i.e. as a descendant of a `xs:schema`
element whose parent is the `wsdl:types` element. It affects the data
binding as specified by Jakarta XML Binding.

Additionally, `jaxb:bindings` MAY appear inside a Jakarta XML Web Services external
binding file as a child of a `jaxws:bindings` element whose `node`
attribute points to a `xs:schema` element inside a WSDL document. When
the schema is processed, the outcome MUST be as if the `jaxb:bindings`
element was inlined inside the schema document as an annotation on the
schema component.

While processing a Jakarta XML Binding binding declaration (i.e. a `jaxb:bindings`
element) for a schema document embedded inside a WSDL document, all
XPath expressions that appear inside it MUST be interpreted as if the
containing `xs:schema` element was the root of a standalone schema
document.

[NOTE]
.Editors Note
====
_This last requirement ensures that Jakarta XML Binding processors
don’t have to be extended to incorporate knowledge of WSDL.
In particular, it becomes possible to take a Jakarta XML Binding
binding file and embed it in a Jakarta XML Web Services binding
file as-is, without fixing up all its XPath expressions, even in the
case that the XML Schema the Jakarta XML Binding binding file
refers to was embedded in a WSDL._
====

[[scopingofbindings]]
=== Scoping of Bindings

Binding declarations are scoped according to the parent-child hierarchy
in the WSDL document. For instance, when determining the value of the
`jaxws:enableWrapperStyle` customization parameter for a portType
operation, binding declarations MUST be processed in the following
order, according to the element they pertain to: (1) the portType
operation in question, (2) its parent portType, (3) the definitions
element.

Tools MUST NOT ignore binding declarations. It is an error if upon
applying all the customizations in effect for a given WSDL document, any
of the generated Java source code artifacts does not contain legal Java
syntax. In particular, it is an error to use any reserved keywords as
the name of a Java field, method, type or package.

[[standardbindingdeclarations]]
=== Standard Binding Declarations

The following sections detail the predefined binding declarations,
classified according to the WSDL element they’re allowed on. All these
declarations reside in the `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxws` namespace.

[[bindingdecldefinitions]]
==== Definitions

The following binding declarations MAY appear in the context of a WSDL
document, either as an extension to the `wsdl:definitions` element or in
an external binding file at a place where there is a WSDL document in
scope.

The `enableWrapperStyle` declaration only affects operations that
qualify for the wrapper style per the Jakarta XML Web Services specification. By default,
this declaration is `true`, i.e. wrapper style processing is turned on
by default for all qualified operations, and must be disabled by using a
`jaxws:enableWrapperStyle` declaration with a value of `false` in the
appropriate scope.

[[semantics-8]]
*Semantics*

method/@name::
The name of the generated port getter method.
method/javadoc/text()::
Method-level javadoc string.
provider::
This binding declaration specifies that the annotated port will be
used with the `jakarta.xml.ws.Provider` interface.

A port annotated with a `jaxws:provider` binding declaration is treated
specially. No service endpoint interface will be generated for it, since
the application code will use in its lieu the `jakarta.xml.ws.Provider`
interface. Additionally, the port getter method on the generated service
interface will be omitted.

[NOTE]
.Editors Note
====
_Omitting a getXYZPort() method is necessary for consistency, because if
it existed it would specify the non-existing SEI type as its return
type._
