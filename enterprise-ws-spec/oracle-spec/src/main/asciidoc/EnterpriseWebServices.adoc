== [#anchor-1]##[#anchor-2]##[#anchor-3]##Introduction

This specification defines the Web Services for Java EE (WSEE)
architecture. This is a service architecture that leverages the Java EE
component architecture to provide a client and server programming model
which is portable and interoperable across application servers, provides
a scalable secure environment, and yet is familiar to Java EE
developers.

=== Target Audience

This specification is intended to be used by:

* Java EE Vendors implementing support for Web services compliant with
this specification
* Developers of Web service implementations to be deployed into Java EE
application servers
* Developers of Web service clients to be deployed into Java EE
application servers
* Developers of Web service clients that access Web service
implementations deployed into Java EE application servers

This specification assumes that the reader is familiar with the Java EE
platform and specifications. It also assumes that the reader is familiar
with Web services, specifically the JAX-RPC and JAX-WS Specification and
WSDL documents.

=== Acknowledgments

This specification’s origins are based on the vision of Donald F.
Ferguson, IBM Fellow. It has been refined by an industry wide expert
group. The expert group included active representation from the
following companies: IBM, Sun, Oracle, BEA, Sonic Software, SAP, HP,
Silverstream, IONA. We would like to thank those companies along with
other members of the JSR 109 expert group: EDS, Macromedia, Interwoven,
Rational Software, Developmentor, interKeel, Borland, Cisco Systems,
ATG, WebGain, Sybase, Motorola, and WebMethods. We particularly
appreciate the amount of input and support provided by Mark Hapner
(Sun).

The JSR 109 expert group had to coordinate with other JSR expert groups
in order to define a consistent programming model for Web Service for
J2EE. We would like to especially thank Rahul Sharma and the JSR 101
(JAX-RPC) expert group, Farukh Najmi and the JSR 093 (JAX-R) expert
group, and Linda G. DeMichiel and the JSR 153 (EJB 2.1) expert group.

Specification Lead), Bhakti Mehta and Rama Pulavarthi (all from Sun
Microsystems) for providing invaluable input for the 1.3 maintenance
release.

=== Specification Organization

The next two chapters of this specification outline the requirements and
conceptual architecture for Web services support in Java EE
environments. Each of the major integration points for Web services in
Java EE, the client model, the server model, the deployment model, WSDL
bindings, and security have their own chapter. Each of these chapters
consists of two topics: Concepts and Specification. The concepts section
discusses how Web services are used, issues, considerations, and the
scenarios that are supported. The specification section is normative and
defines what implementers of this specification must support.

=== Document conventions.

In the interest of consistency, this specification follows the document
conventions used by the Enterprise JavaBeans specification.

The regular Times font is used for information that is prescriptive by
this specification.

The italic Times font is used for paragraphs that contain descriptive
information, such as notes describing typical use, or notes clarifying
the text with prescriptive specification.

The Courier font is used for code examples.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

== Objectives

This section lists the high level objectives of this specification.

* Build on the evolving industry standards for Web services,
specifically WSDL 1.1, SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2.
* Leverage existing Java EE technology.
* Ensure that programmers may implement and package Web services that
properly deploy onto application servers that comply with Java EE and
this specification.
* Ensure that vendor implementations of this specification
inter-operate, i.e. a Web service client on one vendor’s implementation
must be able to interact with Web services executing on another vendors
implementation.
* Define the minimal set of new concepts, interfaces, file formats, etc.
necessary to support Web services within Java EE.
* Clearly and succinctly define functions that Java EE application
server vendors need to provide.
* Define the roles that this specification requires, the functions they
perform and their mapping to Java EE platform roles. Define the
functions that a Web Services for Java EE product provider must provide
to support these roles.
* Support a simple model for defining a new Web service and deploying
this into a Java EE application server.

=== Client Model Goals

The client programming model should be conformant and compatible with
the client programming model defined by JAX-RPC or JAX-WS.

Additional goals for the client programming model are to ensure that:

* Programmers can implement Web services client applications conforming
to this specification that may reside in a Java EE container (e.g. an
EJB that uses a Web service), or a Java EE Client Container can call a
Web service running in a Web Services for Java EE container.
* Client applications conforming to this specification can call any SOAP
1.1 or SOAP 1.2 based Web service through the HTTP 1.1 or HTTPS SOAP
Bindings.
* Programmers using other client environments such as Java 2 Standard
Edition environment can call a Web service running in a Web Services for
Java EE container. Programmers using languages other than Java must be
able to implement SOAP 1.1 or SOAP 1.2 compliant applications that can
use Web services conforming to this specification. Support the Client
Development Scenarios described in Chapter 4.
* Client developers must not have to be aware of how the service
implementation is realized.
* Java 2 Micro Edition clients, defined by JSR 172, should be able to
interoperate using the transport standards declared within WSDL and the
JAX-RPC or JAX-WS runtime with Web Services for Java EE applications.

=== Service Development Goals

The service development model defines how web service implementations
are to be developed and deployed into existing Java EE containers and
includes the following specific goals:

* How the Web service has been implemented should be transparent to the
Web service client. A client should not have to know if the Web service
has been deployed in a Java EE or non-Java EE environment.
* Because the Web service implementation must be deployed in a Java EE
container, the class implementing the service must conform to some
defined requirements to ensure that it does not compromise the integrity
of the application server.
* JAX-RPC defines three server side run time categories, J2SE based
JAX-RPC Runtime, Servlet Container Based JAX-RPC Runtime, and Java EE
Container Based JAX-RPC Runtime. This specification defines the Java EE
container based (Web and EJB) runtime such that it is consistent with
the Servlet Container based model defined by the JAX-RPC specification.
* This specification is amended to define the Java EE container based
(Web and EJB) runtime such that it is consistent with the programming
model defined by the JAX-WS specification.
* Support mapping and dispatching SOAP 1.1 or 1.2 requests to methods on
Java EE Stateless or Singleton(only JAX-WS) Session Beans.
* Support mapping and dispatching SOAP 1.1 or 1.2 requests to methods on
JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Endpoint classes in the Web Container.

=== Service Deployment Goals

* Web service deployment is declarative. We do this through extending
the Java EE model for deployment descriptors and EAR file format. These
changes are minimized, however.
* Web service deployment is supported on Java EE environments.
* Deployment requires that a service be representable by WSDL.
Deployment requires a WSDL file. The deployment of Web services must
support:

* those who wish to deploy a Web service as the focus of the deployment
* those who wish to expose existing, deployed Java EE components as a
Web service

=== Service Publication Goals

* Service deployment may publish the WSDL to the appropriate service
registry, repository (if required by the Web service), File, or URL.
* If a Web service needs to be published by the deployment tools, all of
the data required to perform the publication must be provided in the
deployment package or during the deployment process.
* If any publication to UDDI is performed, the WSDL must also be made
available at a URL.

=== Web Services Registry Goals

The Web services registry API and programming model is out of the scope
of this specification. The Web service implementation, Web service
client, or Web service deployment tool may use any registry API
including JAX-R. JAX-R does not support WSDL publication directly. It
does support interaction with UDDI directories. UDDI.org specifies how
to publish a WSDL described service to a UDDI directory.

This specification defines the service publication responsibilities of
the deployment tool.

Service definition discovery (finding the WSDL to be implemented) during
development or deployment of a service implementation is not defined.

Service discovery during development, deployment, or runtime of service
clients is not defined.

== Overview

This chapter provides an overview of Web services in general and how Web
Services for Java EE fits into the Java EE platform.

=== Web Services Architecture Overview

Web services is a service oriented architecture which allows for
creating an abstract definition of a service, providing a concrete
implementation of a service, publishing and finding a service, service
instance selection, and interoperable service use. In general a Web
service implementation and client use may be decoupled in a variety of
ways. Client and server implementations can be decoupled in programming
model. Concrete implementations may be decoupled in logic and transport.

image:1.png[image,width=397,height=298]

* Figure 1 Service oriented architecture

The service provider defines an abstract service description using the
Web Services Description Language (WSDL). A concrete Service is then
created from the abstract service description yielding a concrete
service description in WSDL. The concrete service description can then
be published to a registry such as Universal Description, Discovery and
Integration (UDDI). A service requestor can use a registry to locate a
service description and from that service description select and use a
concrete implementation of the service.

The abstract service description is defined in a WSDL document as a
PortType. A concrete Service instance is defined by the combination of a
PortType, transport & encoding binding and an address as a WSDL port.
Sets of ports are aggregated into a WSDL service.

=== [#anchor-4]##Web Service

There is no commonly accepted definition for a _Web service._ For the
purposes of this specification, a Web service is defined as a component
with the following characteristics:

* A service implementation implements the methods of an interface that
is describable by WSDL. The methods are implemented using a
Stateless/Singleton Session EJB or JAX-RPC/JAX-WS web component.
* A Web service may have its interface published in one or more
registries for Web services during deployment.
* A Web Service implementation, which uses only the functionality
described by this specification, can be deployed in any Web Services for
Java EE compliant application server.
* A service instance, called a Port, is created and managed by a
container.
* Run-time service requirements, such as security attributes, are
separate from the service implementation. Tools can define these
requirements during assembly or deployment.
* A container mediates access to the service.

JAX-RPC and JAX-WS define a programming model mapping of a WSDL document
to Java which provides a factory (Service) for selecting which
aggregated Port a client wishes to use. See link:#anchor-5[Figure 2] for
a logical diagram. In general, the transport, encoding, and address of
the Port are transparent to the client. The client only needs to make
method calls on the Service Endpoint Interface, as defined by JAX-RPC or
JAX-WS, (i.e. PortType) to access the service. See Chapter
link:#anchor-6[4] for more details.

=== Web Services for _*Java EE*_ Overview

The Web Services for Java EE specification defines the required
architectural relationships as shown in link:#anchor-7[Figure 3]. This
is a logical relationship and does not impose any requirements on a
container provider for structuring containers and processes. The
additions to the Java EE platform include a port component that depends
on container functionality provided by the web and EJB containers, and
the SOAP/HTTP transport.

image:3.png[image,width=371,height=280]

* [#anchor-7]##Figure 3 Java EE architecture diagram

Web Services for Java EE requires that a Port be referencable from the
client, web, and EJB containers. This specification does not require
that a Port be accessible from the applet container.

This specification adds additional artifacts to those defined by JAX-RPC
or JAX-WS that may be used to implement Web services, a role based
development methodology, portable packaging and Java EE container
services to the Web services architecture. These are described in later
sections.

==== Web Service Components

This specification defines two means for implementing a Web service,
which runs in a Java EE environment, but does not restrict Web service
implementations to just those means. The first is a container based
extension of the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS programming model which defines a Web
service as a Java class running in the web container. The second uses a
constrained implementation of a stateless session EJB or singleton
session EJB(only for JAX-WS services) in the EJB container. Other
service implementations are possible, but are not defined by this
specification.

==== Web Service Containers

The container provides for life cycle management of the service
implementation, concurrency management of method invocations, and
security services. A container provides the services specific to
supporting Web services in a Java EE environment. This specification
does not require that a new container be implemented. Existing Java EE
containers may be used and indeed are expected to be used to host Web
services. Web service instance life cycle and concurrency management is
dependent on which container the service implementation runs in. A
JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Endpoint implementation in a web container
follows standard servlet life cycle and concurrency requirements and an
EJB implementation in an EJB container follows standard EJB life cycle
and concurrency requirements.

=== Platform Roles

This specification defines the responsibilities of the existing Java EE
platform roles. There are no new roles defined by this specification.
There are two roles specific to Web Services for Java EE used within
this specification, but they can be mapped onto existing Java EE
platform roles. The Web Services for Java EE product provider role can
be mapped to a Java EE product provider role and the Web services
container provider role can be mapped to a container provider role
within the Java EE specification.

In general, the developer role is responsible for the service
definition, implementation, and packaging within a Java EE module. The
assembler role is responsible for assembling the module into an
application, and the deployer role is responsible for publishing the
deployed services and resolving client references to services. More
details on role responsibilities can be found in later sections.

=== Portability

A standard packaging format, declarative deployment model, and standard
run-time services provide portability of applications developed using
Web services. A Web services specific deployment descriptor included in
a standard Java EE module defines the Web service use of that module.
More details on Web services deployment descriptors can be found in
later chapters. Deployment tools supporting Web Services for Java EE are
required to be able to deploy applications packaged according to this
specification.

Web services container providers may provide support for additional
service implementations and additional transport and encoding bindings
at the possible expense of application portability.

=== Standard Services

The Java EE platform defines a set of standard services a Java EE
provider must supply. The Web Services for Java EE specification
identifies an additional set of run-time services that are required.

==== JAX-RPC1.1

JAX-RPC 1.1 provides run-time services for marshalling and demarshalling
Java data and objects to and from XML SOAP messages. In addition,
JAX-RPC defines the WSDL to Java mappings for a Service Endpoint
Interface and a Service class.

==== JAX-WS 2.2

JAX-WS 2.0 is a follow-on specification to JAX-RPC 1.1. In addition to
providing all the run-time services, it improves upon JAX-RPC 1.1
specification by providing support for SOAP 1.2, using JAXB 2.0
specification for all data binding-related tasks, providing support for
Web Services metadata etc .

JAX-WS 2.2 adds a complete Web Services addressing support as specified
in Web Services Addressing 1.0 - Core, Web Services Addressing 1.0 -
Soap Binding, and Web Services Addressing 1.0 - Metadata.

=== Interoperability

This specification extends the interoperability requirements of the Java
EE platform by defining interoperability requirements for products that
implement this specification on top of Java EE™. The interoperability
requirements rely on the interoperability of existing standards that
this specification depends on.

The specification builds on the evolving work of the following JSRs and
specifications:

* Java™ API for XML-based RPC (JAX-RPC) 1.1
* Java™ API for XML-based Web Services (JAX-WS) 2.2
* Java Enterprise Edition Specification
* Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
* Java Servlet Specification
* WS-I Basic Profile 1.0

=== Scope

The following sections define the scope of what is and what is not
covered by this specification.

==== Scope

* The scope of this specification is limited to Web service standards
that are widely documented and accepted in the industry. These include:

* SOAP 1.1, SOAP 1.2 and SOAP with Attachments
* WSDL 1.1
* UDDI 1.0

* This specification is limited to defining support for SOAP over HTTP
1.1 or HTTPS protocols and communication APIs for Web services (vendors
are free to support additional transports).
* These standards are expected to continue to change and evolve. Future
versions of this specification will accommodate and address future
versions of these standards. In this specification, all references to
SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI are assumed to be the versions defined above.

==== Not in Scope

* The most glaring deficiency of SOAP over HTTP is basic reliable
message semantics. Despite this deficiency, this JSR does not consider
Message Reliability or Message Integrity to be in scope. Other JSRs,
like the evolution and convergence of JAX-M and JMS, as well as
activities in W3C and other standard bodies will define these
capabilities.
* Persistence of XML data.
* Workflow and data flow models.
* Arbitrary XML transformation.
* Client programming model for Web service clients that do not conform
to this specification.

=== Web Service Client View

The client view of a Web service is quite similar to the client view of
an Enterprise JavaBean. A client of a Web service can be another Web
service, a Java EE component, including a Java EE application client, or
an arbitrary Java application. A non-Java application or non-Web
Services for Java EE application can also be a client of Web service,
but the client view for such applications is out of scope of this
specification.

The Web service client view is remotable and provides local-remote
transparency.

The Port provider and container together provide the client view of a
Web service. This includes the following:

* Service interface or class
* Service Endpoint interface

The JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Handler interface is considered a container SPI
and is therefore not part of the client view.

image:4.png[image,width=282,height=139]

Figure 4 Web Service Client View

The Service Interface/Class defines the methods a client may use to
access a Port of a Web service. A client does not create or remove a
Port. It uses the Service Interface/Class to obtain access to a Port.
The Service interface/class is defined by the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
specification, but its behavior is defined by a WSDL document supplied
by the Web service provider. The container’s deployment tools provide an
implementation of the methods of the Service Interface/Class or the
JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Generated Service Interface.

A client locates a Service Interface by using JNDI APIs. This is
explained further in Chapter link:#anchor-8[4].

A Web service implementation is accessed by the client using the Service
Endpoint Interface. The Service Endpoint Interface is specified by the
service provider. The deployment tools and container run-time provide
server side classes which dispatch a SOAP request to a Web service
implementation which implements the methods of the Service Endpoint
Interface. The Service Endpoint Interface extends the java.rmi.Remote
interface and is fully defined by the JAX-RPC specification. JAX-WS
specification does not require Service Endpoint Interface to extend the
java.rmi.Remote interface

A Port has no identity within the client view and is considered a
stateless object.

===  Web Service Server View

Chapter link:#anchor-9[5] link:#anchor-10[Server Programming Model]
defines the details of the server programming model. This section
defines the general requirements for the service provider.

The service provider defines the WSDL PortType, WSDL binding, and
Service Endpoint Interface of a Web service. The PortType and Service
Endpoint Interface must follow the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS rules for
WSDL->Java and Java->WSDL mapping.

The service provider defines the WSDL service and aggregation of ports
in the WSDL document.

The business logic of a Web service is implemented by a service provider
in one of two different ways:

[arabic]
. A Stateless Session Bean: The service provider implements the Web
service business logic by creating a stateless session Bean that
implements the methods of the Service Endpoint Interface as described in
the Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 specification.
. A Java class: The service provider implements the Web service business
logic according to the requirements defined by the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
Servlet based service implementation model.
. A Singleton Session Bean: The service provider implements the JAX-WS
Web service business logic by creating a singleton session bean that
implements the methods of the Service Endpoint Interface as described in
the EJB 3.1 specification.

The life cycle management of a Web service is specific to the service
implementation methodology.

The service provider implements the container callback methods specific
to the service implementation methodology used. See the JAX-RPC, JAX-WS
specification and Enterprise JavaBeans specification for details on the
container callback methods.

The container manages the run-time services required by the Web service,
such as security. The default behavior requires that if a client
accesses a Port with a transaction context, it will be suspended before
the Port is accessed. This ensures that remote and local invocations
using a SOAP/HTTP binding do not behave differently. Vendors may support
transaction propagation (e.g. using WS-AtomicTransaction) as long as the
transactional behavior is consistent for local and remote invocations.

Service providers must avoid programming practices that interfere with
container operation. These restrictions are defined by the Java EE,
Servlet, and EJB specifications.

Packaging of a Web service in a Java EE module is specific to the
service implementation methodology, but follows the Java EE requirements
for an EJB-JAR file or WAR file. It contains the Java class files of the
Service Endpoint Interface and WSDL documents for the Web service. In
addition it contains an XML deployment descriptor which defines the Web
service Ports and their structure. Packaging requirements are described
in Section link:#anchor-11[5.4] link:#anchor-12[Packaging].

=== Java EE profiles

The Java EE 6 platform specification introduces "profiles" to target
specific class of applications. See chapter 9 of Java EE 6 specification
for more details.

The Java EE 6 platform marks JAX-RPC as a proposed optional technology
that may be pruned in a future release. Therefore, requirements in this
specification related to JAX-RPC should also be considered proposed
optional. Such requirements may be made optional in a future release of
this specification.

This specification gives choices for the vendors that want to support
only certain containers for JAX-WS web services. A JSR-109
implementation must support at least one of the following configurations
for JAX-WS web services:

* JAX-WS web component in a Servlet container
* Stateless or Singleton Session EJB as JAX-WS web service

== [#anchor-13]##[#anchor-14]##[#anchor-15]##[#anchor-6]##[#anchor-16]##[#anchor-17]##[#anchor-8]##[#anchor-18]##Client Programming Model

This chapter defines the client programming model of Web Services for
Java EE. In general, the client programming model is covered in detail
by the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS specification. This specification covers the
use of the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS client programming model in a Java EE
environment.

Differences between this specification and the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
specification will be noted in this style.

=== [#anchor-19]##[#anchor-20]##[#anchor-21]##[#anchor-22]##[#anchor-23]##[#anchor-24]##[#anchor-25]##Concepts

Clients of Web services are not limited to clients defined within this
specification, however the client programming model for non-Web Services
for Java EE clients is not specifically addressed by this specification.
In general, the WSDL definition of a Web service provides enough
information for a non-Web Services for Java EE client to be built and
run, but the programming model for that is undefined. The rest of this
chapter covers the programming model for Web Services for Java EE
clients. It makes no assumption on whether the Web service
implementation invoked by the client is hosted by a Web Services for
Java EE run-time or some external run-time.

A client uses the Web Services for Java EE run-time to access and invoke
the methods of a Web service. A client can be any of the following: Java
EE application client, web component, EJB component, or another Web
service.

The client view of a Web service is a set of methods that perform
business logic on behalf of the client. A client cannot distinguish
whether the methods are being performed locally or remotely, nor can the
client distinguish how the service is implemented. Lastly, a client must
assume that the methods of a Web service have no state that is
persistent across multiple Web service method invocations. A client can
treat the Web service implementation as stateless.

A client accesses a Web service using a Service Endpoint Interface as
defined by the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS specification. A reference to the Web
service implementation should never be passed to another object. A
client should never access the Web service implementation directly.
Doing so bypasses the container’s request processing which may open
security holes or cause anomalous behavior.

A client uses JNDI lookup to access a Service object that implements the
Service Interface/Class as defined by the JAX-RPC and JAX-WS
specification. The Service object is a factory used by the client to get
a stub or proxy that implements the Service Endpoint Interface. The stub
is the client representation of an instance of the Web service.

The Service Interface can be a generic javax.xml.rpc.Service interface
or a Generated Service Interface, which extends javax.xml.rpc.Service,
as defined by JAX-RPC. With JAX-WS, the Service Class can be the generic
javax.xml.ws.Service class or a Generated Service class, which extends
javax.xml.ws.Service. Further references in this document to the Service
Interface/Class refer to either the generic or generated version, unless
noted otherwise.

The client has no control over the life cycle of the Web service
implementation on the server. A client does not create or destroy
instances of a Web service, which is referred to as a Port. The client
only accesses the Port. The life cycle of the Ports, or instances of a
Web service implementation, are managed by the run-time that hosts the
Web service. A Port has no identity. This means that a client cannot
compare a Port to other Ports to see if they are the same or identical,
nor can a client access a specific Port instance. A client cannot tell
if a server crashes and restarts if the crash and restart complete in
between Web service access.

A client developer starts with the Service Endpoint Interface and
Service Interface/Class. How a developer obtains these is out of scope,
but includes having the Web service provider supply them or tools
generate them from a WSDL definition supplied by the Web service
provider. These tools operate according to the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS rules
for WSDL->Java mapping. A client developer does not need to generate
stubs during development, nor are they encouraged to do so. The client
should use the interfaces, and not the stubs. Stubs will be generated
during deployment and will be specific to the vendor’s run-time the
client will run in.

Each client JNDI lookup of a Web service is by a logical name. A client
developer chooses the logical name to be used in the client code and
declares it along with the required Service Interface/Class in a Web
service client deployment descriptor. The client should use the Service
interfaces/classes, and not the stubs.

The Service Interface methods can be categorized into two groups:
stub/proxy and DII. The stub/proxy methods provide both service specific
(client requires WSDL knowledge) and service agnostic (does not require
WSDL knowledge) access to Ports. In JAX-RPC, DII methods are used when a
client needs dynamic, non-stub based communication with the Web service.

A client can use the stub/proxy methods of the Service Interface/Class
to get a Port stub or dynamic proxy. The WSDL specific methods can be
used when the full WSDL definition of the service is available to the
client developer. The WSDL agnostic methods must be used if the client
developer has a partial WSDL definition that only contains only the
portType and bindings.

With JAX-WS, a client can also use the Service Class to work at the XML
message level using Dispatch APIs. Additionally a client can also make
asynchronous invocations using both stubs and Dispatch APIs.

=== Specification

The following sections define the requirements for Java EE product
providers that implement Web Services for Java EE and developers for
creating applications that run in such an environment.

==== [#anchor-26]##Service Lookup

The client developer is required to define a logical JNDI name for the
Web service called a service reference. This name is specified in the
deployment descriptor for the client. It is recommended, but not
required that all service reference logical names be organized under the
service subcontext of a JNDI name space. The container must bind the
Service Interface implementation under the client’s environment context,
java:comp/env, using the logical name of the service reference. In the
following examples, the logical service name declared in the client
deployment descriptor is service/AddressBookService.

The container acts as a mediator on behalf of the client to ensure a
Service Interface is available via a JNDI lookup. More specifically, the
container must ensure that an implementation of the required Service
Interface is bound at a location in the JNDI namespace of the client’s
choosing as declared by the service reference in the Web services client
deployment descriptor. This is better illustrated in the following code
segment:

InitialContext ic = new InitialContext ();

Service abf = (Service)ic.lookup(

"java:comp/env/service/AddressBookService");

In the above example, the container must ensure that an implementation
of the generic Service Interface, javax.xml.rpc.Service or generic
Service class, javax.xml.ws.Service, is bound in the JNDI name space at
a location specified by the developer. A similar code fragment is used
for access to an object that implements a Generated Service Interface
such as AddressBookService.

InitialContext ic = new InitialContext ();

AddressBookService abf = (AddressBookService)ic.lookup(

"java:comp/env/service/AddressBookService");

A Java EE product provider is required to provide Service lookup support
in the web, EJB, and application client containers.

==== javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotation

With JAX-WS, client developer may use the javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef
annotation to denote a reference to a Service or a Service endpoint.
Lookups using JNDI mechanism for both Service or Service endpoint can
also be used under JAX-WS. Complete definition of
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotation is defined in section 7.9 of
JAX-WS specification. The containers must ensure that the use of this
annotation is supported.

The annotations (for example, _@javax.xml.ws.soap.Addressing_) annotated
with meta-annotation _javax.xml.ws.spi.WebServiceFeatureAnnotation_ can
be used in conjunction with _@WebServiceRef_. The created reference MUST
be configured with annotation's web service feature. If a JAX-WS
implementation encounters an unsupported or unrecognized feature
annotation, an error must be given. JAX-WS doesn't define any standard
portable web service feature for Service references. But it defines
_@Addressing_, _@MTOM_, _@RespectBinding_ annotations for SEI proxy
references.

By using a web service feature annotation explicitly along with a
_@WebServiceRef_, an application overrides WSDL's indication of that
feature for the reference. Also, _<enable-mtom>_, _<addressing>_, and
_<respect-binding>_ deployment descriptor elements can be used to
override the _@MTOM_, _@Addressing_, and _@RespectBinding_ features
respectively for a reference.

The following example illustrates the use of this annotation when
declaring a Service:

_@WebServiceRef(name="java:comp/env/service/AddressBookService"_)

AddressBookService abf;

The same annotation can also be used to declare a SEI proxy reference,
the injected SEI proxy reference is configured with MTOM feature:

@MTOM

@WebServiceRef(

name="java:comp/env/service/AddressBookService",

AddressBookService.class)

AddressBookPort port;

Address address = port.getAddress(“John Doe”);

A declared reference can be resolved using lookup functionality
specified by JAX-WS specification. The following example illustrates the
use of this annotation for looking up a Service:

_@WebServiceRef(lookup="java:comp/env/service/AddressBookService"_)

AddressBookService other;

javax.jws.HandlerChain annotation can be used with this annotation to
specify handlers on these client side references. More information on
the HandlerChain annotation can be found in JSR-181 specification and
also in Chapter 6 of this specification.

If wsdlLocation attribute of WebServiceRef annotation is specified, it
is always relative to the root of the module. HTTP URL can also be
specified here. The <wsdl-file> element in client deployment descriptor
(section 7.2) always overrides the wsdlLocation specified in the
annotation. If there is no <wsdl-file> element or wsdlLocation specified
in the annotation, then the wsdlLocation attribute of @WebServiceClient
annotation on the generated Service class needs to be consulted.
(section 7.5 of JAX-WS specification).

For co-located clients (where the client and the server are in the same
Java EE application unit) with generated Service class, the location of
the final WSDL document is resolved by comparing the Service name on the
@WebServiceClient annotation on the the generated Service to the Service
names of all the deployed port components in the Java EE application
unit. This default behavior can be overridden using the
<port-component-link> deployment descriptor element. Refer to client
deployment descriptor schema Section 7.2.5

If the name attribute is not specified in this annotation then default
naming rules apply as specified in the Java EE specification. (section
EE.5.2.3)

The following table summarizes the relationship between the deployment
descriptors for <service-ref> and member attributes of this annotation .

* Table 1 Relationship between the deployment descriptor elements and
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotation

[cols=",",]
|===
|<service-ref> |One per @WebServiceRef annotation

|<service-ref>/<service-ref-name> |@WebServiceRef.name

|<service-ref>/<wsdl-file> |@WebServiceRef.wsdlLocation

|<service-ref>/<service-interface> a|
@WebServiceRef.type when @WebServiceRef.value is not specified. In other
words the annotation is used to declare a Service.

OR

@WebServiceRef.value when @WebServiceRef.type is a Service
Endpoint.class

The type attribute is implied when this annotation is used on a field.
Similar to @Resource annotation in JSR-250 Common Annotations for Java
Platform

|<service-ref>/<port-component-ref>/<service-endpoint-interface>
|@WebServiceRef.type when @WebServiceRef.value is a Service class.

|<service-ref>/<port-component-ref>/<port-component-link> |Default
mechanism used for co-located case. The deployment descriptor is used
only for overriding the default behavior.

|<service-ref>/<service-ref-type> |@WebServiceRef.type

|<service-ref>/<mapped-name> |@WebServiceRef.mappedName

|<service-ref>/<lookup-name> |@WebServiceRef.lookup
|===

@WebServiceRef reference instances are not guaranteed to be thread safe.
If the instances are accessed by multiple threads, usual synchronization
techniques can be used to support multiple threads.

For declaring multiple references to Web services on a single class
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRefs annotation may be used. Complete definition
of javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRefs annotation is defined in section 7.10 of
JAX-WS specification. The containers must ensure that the use of this
annotation is supported.

==== Port Lookup

With JAX-WS, the client developer can also use JNDI lookups for a Port.
This is analogous to using the javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotation for
Service endpoint. The client side deployment descriptor has been
modified to introduce a new optional element <service-ref-type> that
declares the type of <service-ref> returned when a dependency injection
or JNDI lookup is done. If this element is not specified in the
deployment descriptor, then the type of <service-ref> is always a
Service class or a generated Service class.

A Java EE product provider is required to provide Port lookup support in
the web, EJB, and application client containers.

==== Service API

The Service API is used by a client to get a stub or dynamic proxy or a
DII Call object for a Port. A container provider is required to support
all methods of the Service interface/class except for the
getHandlerRegistry() and getTypeMappingRegistry() methods as described
in sections link:#anchor-27[4.2.4.8] and link:#anchor-28[4.2.4.9].

A client developer must declare the Service Interface/Class type used by
the application in the client deployment descriptor. The Service
Interface/Class represents the deployed WSDL of a service.

===== [#anchor-29]##Stub/proxy access

With JAX-RPC, the client may use the following Service Interface methods
to obtain a static stub or dynamic proxy for a Web service:

java.rmi.Remote getPort(QName portName, Class serviceEndpointInterface)
throws ServiceException;

java.rmi.Remote getPort(java.lang.Class serviceEndpointInterface) throws
ServiceException;

With JAX-WS, the client may use the following Service class methods to
obtain a proxy for a Web service:

<T> T getPort(QName portName, Class<T> serviceEndpointInterface);

<T> T getPort(java.lang.Class<T> serviceEndpointInterface);

<T> T getPort(Class<T> serviceEndpointInterface,

WebServiceFeature... features);

<T> T getPort(EndpointReference endpointReference,

Class<T> serviceEndpointInterface,

WebServiceFeature... features);

<T> T getPort(QName portName, Class<T> serviceEndpointInterface,

WebServiceFeature... features);

The client may also use the additional methods of the Generated Service
Interface/Class to obtain a static stub or dynamic proxy for a Web
service.

The container must provide at least one of static stub or dynamic proxy
support for these methods as described in section
link:#anchor-30[4.2.5]. The container must ensure the stub or dynamic
proxy is fully configured for use by the client, before it is returned
to the client. The deployment time choice of whether a stub or dynamic
proxy is returned by the getPort or get<port name> methods is out of the
scope of this specification. Container providers are free to offer
either one or both.

The container provider must provide Port resolution for the
getPort(java.lang.Class serviceEndpointInterface) method. This is useful
for resolving multiple WSDL ports that use the same binding or when
ports are unknown at development time. A client must declare its
dependency on container Port resolution for a Service Endpoint Interface
in the client deployment descriptor. If a dependency for resolving the
interface argument to a port is not declared in the client deployment
descriptor, the container may provide a default resolution capability or
throw a ServiceException.

===== Dynamic Port access

With JAX-RPC, a client may use the following DII methods of a Service
Interface located by a JNDI lookup of the client’s environment to obtain
a Call object:

Call createCall() throws ServiceException;

Call createCall(QName portName) throws ServiceException;

Call createCall(QName portName, String operationName) throws
ServiceException;

Call createCall(QName portName, QName operationName) throws
ServiceException;

Call[] getCalls(QName portName) throws ServiceException;

A DII Call object may or may not be pre-configured for use depending on
the method used to obtain it. See the JAX-RPC specification for details.

These methods are not supported in JAX-WS. JAX-WS provides Dispatch APIs
to enable the client to operate at XML message level. See section 4.2.6.

===== ServiceFactory

Use of the JAX-RPC ServiceFactory class is not recommended in a Web
Services for Java EE product. A Web Services for Java EE client must
obtain a Service Interface/Class using JNDI lookup as described in
section link:#anchor-26[4.2.1]. Container providers are not required to
support managed Service instances created from a ServiceFactory.

ServiceFactory class has been removed from JAX-WS. It has been replaced
by two static methods Service.create(QName serviceName)and
Service.create(URL wsdlLocation, QName serviceName) for creating Service
instances. These methods rely on specific implementations of
ServiceDelegate Class in any JAX-WS compliant implementation. The use of
these static methods is not recommended in a Web Services for Java EE
product. A Web Services for Java EE client must obtain a Service
Interface/Class using JNDI lookup as described in section
link:#anchor-26[4.2.1]. Container providers are not required to support
managed Service instances created using these methods.

===== [#anchor-31]##Service method use with full WSDL

A client developer may use all methods of the Service Interface (except
as described in sections link:#anchor-27[4.2.4.8] and
link:#anchor-28[4.2.4.9]) or class if a full WSDL description and
JAX-RPC mapping file are declared in the client deployment descriptor.
If JAX-WS is used, mapping file is not required because all of the data
binding in JAX-WS is done according to the JAXB specification. The port
address location attribute of a port using a SOAP/HTTP binding must
begin with http: or https:.

If a client developer uses the getPort(SEI) method of a Service
Interface/Class and the WSDL supports multiple ports the SEI could be
bound to, the developer can indicate to a deployer a binding order
preference by ordering the ports in the service-ref’s WSDL document.

===== [#anchor-32]##Service method use with partial WSDL

With JAX-RPC, a client developer may use the following methods of the
Service Interface if a partial WSDL definition is declared in the client
deployment descriptor:

Call createCall() throws ServiceException;

java.rmi.Remote getPort(java.lang.Class serviceEndpointInterface) throws
ServiceException;

javax.xml.namespace.QName getServiceName();

java.util.Iterator getPorts() throws ServiceException;

java.net.URL getWSDLDocumentLocation()

If JAX-WS is used, client developer may use the following methods of the
Service class:

<T> T getPort(java.lang.Class(T) serviceEndpointInterface);

javax.xml.namespace.QName getServiceName();

java.util.Iterator<javax.xml.namespace.QName> getPorts();

java.net.URL getWSDLDocumentLocation();

<T> Dispatch<T> createDispatch(javax.xml.namespace.QName portName,

java.lang.Class<T> type,

Service.Mode mode);

Dispatch<java.lang.Object> createDispatch(QName portName,

JAXBContext context,

Service.Mode mode);

java.util.concurrent.Executor getExecutor();

void setExecutor(java.util.concurrent.Executor executor);

<T> Dispatch<T> createDispatch(QName portName, Class<T> type,

Service.Mode mode,

WebServiceFeature... features);

Dispatch<Object> createDispatch(QName portName, JAXBContext context,

Service.Mode mode,

WebServiceFeature... features);

<T> Dispatch<T> createDispatch(EndpointReference endpointReference,

Class<T> type, Service.Mode mode,

WebServiceFeature... features);

Dispatch<Object> createDispatch(EndpointReference endpointReference,

JAXBContext context, Service.Mode mode,

WebServiceFeature... features);

A partial WSDL definition is defined as a fully specified WSDL document
which contains no service or port elements. The JAX-RPC mapping file
specified by the developer will not include a service-interface-mapping
in this case. If JAX-WS is used, mapping file is not required and
ignored if specified, because all of the data binding in JAX-WS is done
according to the JAXB specification

Use of other methods of the Service Interface/Class is not recommended
when a developer specifies a partial WSDL definition. The behavior of
the other methods is unspecified.

The container must provide access to all SEIs declared by the
port-component-ref elements of the service-ref through the getPort(SEI)
method.

===== Service method use with no WSDL

With JAX-RPC, a client developer may use the following methods of the
Service Interface if no WSDL definition is specified in the client
deployment descriptor:

Call createCall() throws ServiceException;

If the wsdl-file is not specified in the deployment descriptor, the
jaxrpc-mapping-file must not be specified.

With JAX-WS, a client developer may use the following methods of the
Service class if no WSDL definition is specified in the client
deployment descriptor:

<T> Dispatch<T> createDispatch(javax.xml.namespace.QName portName,

java.lang.Class<T> type,

Service.Mode mode);

Dispatch<java.lang.Object> createDispatch(QName portName,

JAXBContext context,

Service.Mode mode);

java.util.concurrent.Executor getExecutor();

void setExecutor(java.util.concurrent.Executor executor);

<T> Dispatch<T> createDispatch(QName portName, Class<T> type,

Service.Mode mode,

WebServiceFeature... features)

Dispatch<Object> createDispatch(QName portName, JAXBContext context,

Service.Mode mode,

WebServiceFeature... features)

<T> Dispatch<T> createDispatch(EndpointReference endpointReference,

Class<T> type, Service.Mode mode,

WebServiceFeature... features)

Dispatch<Object> createDispatch(EndpointReference endpointReference,

JAXBContext context, Service.Mode mode,

WebServiceFeature... features)

Use of other methods of the Service Interface or class is not
recommended. Their behavior is unspecified.

|===

===== [#anchor-27]##Handlers

With JAX-RPC components should not use the getHandlerRegistry() method.
A container provider must throw a
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException from the getHandlerRegistry()
method of the Service Interface. Handler support is documented in
Chapter link:#anchor-33[6] link:#anchor-33[Handlers].

===== [#anchor-28]##Type Mapping

With JAX-RPC components should not use the getTypeMappingRegistry()
method. A container provider must throw a
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException from the
getTypeMappingRegistry() method of the Service Interface.

==== [#anchor-30]##Port Stub and Dynamic Proxy

The following sections define the requirements for implementing and
using static Stubs and Dynamic Proxies.

===== Identity

The Port Stub and Dynamic Proxy are a client’s representation of a Web
service. The Port that a stub or proxy communicates with has no identity
within the client view. The equals() method cannot be used to compare
two stubs or proxy instances to determine if they represent the same
Port. The results of the equals(), hash(), and toString() methods for a
stub are unspecified. There is no way for the client to ensure that a
Port Stub, Dynamic Proxy, or Call will access a particular Port instance
or the same Port instance for multiple invocations.

===== Type narrowing

In JAX-RPC, although the stub and dynamic proxy classes are considered
Remote objects, a client is not required to use
PortableRemoteObject.narrow(…). However, clients are encouraged to use
PortableRemoteObject.narrow(…) to prevent confusion with client use of
other Remote objects.

In JAX-WS, proxy classes are not Remote Objects. Hence the use of
PortableRemoteObject.narrow(…) is not required.

==== [#anchor-34]##JAX_RPC and JAX-WS Properties

The Java EE container environment provides a broader set of operational
characteristics and constraints for supporting the Stub/proxy properties
defined within JAX-RPC or JAX-WS. While support of standard properties
for Stub and Call (only in JAX-RPC) objects is required, their use may
not work in all cases in a Java EE environment.

The following JAX-RPC properties are not recommended for use in a
managed context defined by this specification:

* javax.xml.rpc.security.auth.username
* javax.xml.rpc.security.auth.password

The following JAX-WS properties are not recommended for use in a managed
context defined by this specification:

* javax.xml.ws.security.auth.username
* javax.xml.ws.security.auth.password

===== Required properties

A container provider is required to support the
javax.xml.rpc.service.endpoint.address property in JAX-RPC and
javax.xml.ws.service.endpoint.address property in JAX-WS to allow
components to dynamically redirect a Stub/proxy to a different URI.

==== JAX-WS Dispatch APIs

Client developers may use javax.xml.ws.Dispatch APIs defined in JAX-WS
specification. This is a low level API that requires clients to
construct messages or message payloads as XML and requires an intimate
knowledge of the desired message or payload structure. This is useful in
those situations where the client wants to operate at the XML message
level.

An instance of javax.xml.ws.Dispatch can be obtained by invoking any one
of the two createDispatch(...) methods on a Service interface. Details
on Dispatch API's and its usage can be referenced at section 4.3 of the
JAX-WS specification

==== JAX-WS Asynchronous Operations

Client developer may use asynchronous invocations as defined by the
JAX-WS specification. JAX-WS supports asynchronous invocations through
generated asynchronous methods on the Service Endpoint Interface
(section 2.3.4 of JAX-WS specification) and javax.xml.ws.Dispatch
(section 4.3.3 of JAX-WS specification) interface. There are two forms
of asynchronous invocations in JAX-WS – Polling and Callback.

===== Polling

Client asynchronous polling invocations must be supported by components
running in Servlet container, EJB container and Application Client
container, since any of these components can act as JAX-WS clients.
Client developers can either use the Service Endpoint Interface or
javax.xml.ws.Dispatch to make asynchronous polling invocations. The
usage must meet the requirements defined in section 2.3.4 of JAX-WS
specification for Service Endpoint Interface or section 4.3.3 of JAX-WS
specification for javax.xml.ws.Dispatch interface.

===== Callback

Client asynchronous callback invocations should only be supported by
components running in EJB, Servlet container and Application Client
container. Client developers can either use the Service Endpoint
Interface or javax.xml.ws.Dispatch to implement asynchronous callback
invocations. The callback handler must implement
javax.xml.ws.AsyncHandler interface. The usage should meet the
requirements defined in section 2.3.4 of JAX-WS specification for
Service Endpoint Interface or section 4.3.3 of JAX-WS specification for
javax.xml.ws.Dispatch interface.

It will be the container implementers responsibility to insure that the
client developer has access to java:comp/env JNDI context for that
component in the callback handler's handleResponse(...) method. The
following operations are allowed from within the callback handler:

* JNDI access to java:comp/env
* Resource manager access
* Enterprise bean access

The container implementer is also responsible for ensuring that the
context class loader used for the execution of handleResponse() method
matches the classloader of the component that made the invokeAsync()
call.

Lifecycle of the callback handler is undefined.

It is recommended that the developer use a new instance of the callback
handler for each invokeAsync() call to avoid any multi-threading issues.

The behavior of the execution of the callback handler is undefined if
the module defining the handler, is undeployed before it is invoked.

Dependency injection is not supported for the callback handler classes.
Programmatic JNDI lookups must be used for getting access to any of the
resources.

If no propagated identity is provided for invoking the callback handler,
then the handler executes under unauthenticated identity as defined by
the container.

The handleResponse() method of the javax.xml.ws.AsyncHandler executes in
an unspecified transaction context. If the handleResponse() method of
the callback handler creates a transaction using the JTA UserTransaction
interface then this transaction must be committed or rollbacked before
the return of handleResponse() method.

Requirements for asynchronous callback invocations in the EJB container:

* EJB instance cannot be passed as a callback handler instance. User's
handler implementation must be a separate class from the Bean class.

* The developer should not attempt to cache the EJBContext of the Bean
in the handler. The behavior is undefined if the cached EJBContext is
accessed from within the handler.
* The developer should not attempt to cache the Bean instance itself in
the Handler. The behavior is undefined if the cached Bean is accessed
from within the Handler.

Requirements for asynchronous callback invocations in the Servlet
container:

* Servlet instance cannot be passed as a callback handler instance.
User's handler implementation is a separate class from the Servlet
class.

* The developer should not attempt to cache the Servlet instance itself
in the callback handler. The behavior is undefined if the cached Servlet
is accessed from within the handler.
* It is recommended that the developer not cache the HttpSession and
HttpRequest objects from the Servlet in the callback handler.

==== JAX-RPC and JAX-WS Interoperability

Interoperability between a JAX-RPC client and JAX-WS endpoint (or
vice-versa) is governed by the requirements defined by the WS-I Basic
Profile 1.0. As long as both the client and the server adhere to these
requirements, they should be able to interoperate.

==== MTOM/XOP support

JAX-WS compliant implementations are required to support MTOM (Message
Transmission Optimization Mechanism)/XOP (XML-binary Optimized
Packaging) specifications from W3C. Refer to sections 6.5.2, 7.14.2, and
10.4.1.1 of JAX-WS specification. Support for SOAP MTOM/XOP mechanism
for optimizing transmission of binary data types is provided by JAXB
which is the data binding for JAX-WS. JAX-WS provides the MIME
processing required to enable JAXB to serialize and deserialize MIME
based MTOM/XOP packages.

SOAP MTOM/XOP mechanism on the client can be enabled or disabled by any
one of the following ways:

* Programmatically passing MTOMFeature for a Service method that creates
a SEI proxy or a Dispatch instance.

* Using <port-component-ref>/<enable-mtom> deployment descriptor element
for a corresponding SEI proxy instance.
* Using @MTOM with a @WebServiceRef that creates a SEI proxy instance.

Deployment descriptor mtom elements override the @MTOM annotation for a
corresponding SEI instance.

Table : Relationship between deployment descriptor elements and @MTOM

[cols=",",]
|===
|<service-ref>/<port-component-ref>/<enable-mtom> |@MTOM.enabled
|<service-ref>/<port-component-ref>/<mtom-threshold> |@MTOM.threshold
|===

==== JAX-RPC Custom Serializers / Deserializers

The use of JAX-RPC custom serializers / deserializers is out of scope
for this version of the specification. JAX-RPC customer serializers /
deserializers are not portable across Web Services for Java EE providers
and are therefore not included as part of the portable deployment unit.
It is expected that vendors will provide proprietary solutions to this
problem until it has been addressed by a future version of JAX-RPC.

==== Packaging

The developer is responsible for packaging, either by containment or
reference (i.e. by using the MANIFEST ClassPath to refer to other JAR
files that contain the required classes), the class files for each Web
service including the: Service Endpoint Interface classes, Generated
Service Interface class (if used), and their dependent classes. The
following files must also be packaged in the module: WSDL files, JAX-RPC
Mapping files (not required with JAX-WS), and a Web services client
deployment descriptor (not required with JAX-WS if annotations are used)
in a Java EE module. The location of the Web services client deployment
descriptor in the module is module specific. WSDL files are located
relative to the root of the module and are typically located in the wsdl
directory that is co-located with the module deployment descriptor or a
subdirectory of it. JAX-RPC Mapping Files (not required with JAX-WS) are
located relative to the root of the module and are typically co-located
with the WSDL file. The developer must not package generated stubs.

JAX-WS requires support for a OASIS XML Catalogs 1.1 specification to be
used when resolving any Web service document that is part of the
description of a Web service, specifically WSDL and XML Schema
documents. Refer to section 4.4 of JAX-WS specification. The catalog
file jax-ws-catalog.xml must be co-located with the module deployment
descriptor (WEB-INF/jax-ws-catalog.xml for web modules and
META-INF/jax-ws-catalog.xml for the rest).

==== Web Services Addressing Support

JAX-WS clients are required to support Web Services Addressing 1.0 -
Core, Web Services Addressing 1.0 - Soap Binding, and Web Services
Addressing 1.0 - Metadata.

Web Service Addressing requirements for a client can be specified by any
one of the following ways:

* Using <port-component-ref>/<addressing> deployment descriptor element
for the corresponding client
* Using @Addressing annotation with the @WebServiceRef of the client
* If the service uses WSDL description, the addressing requirements can
be got from the WSDL as per the WS-Addressing 1.0 - Metadata
specification.

The above order also defines a precedence order for the addressing
requirements. For example, the addressing requirements specified by the
@Addressing are overridden by the same from a corresponding
<port-component-ref>/<addressing> deployment descriptor element.

Table : Relationship between deployment descriptor elements and
@Addressing

[cols=",",]
|===
|<service-ref>/<port-component-ref>/<addressing>/<enabled>
|@Addressing.enabled

|<service-ref>/<port-component-ref>/<addressing>/<required>
|@Addressing.required

|<service-ref>/<port-component-ref>/<addressing>/<responses>
|@Addressing.responses
|===

JAX-WS specifies an abstract javax.xml.ws.EndpointReference that
represents a remote reference to a web service endpoint.
javax.xml.ws.addressing.W3CEndpointReference class is a concrete
EndpointReference implementation for WS-Addressing 1.0 - Core addressing
version. Client applications can use an EndpointReference to get a port
for an SEI using the getPort methods on javax.xml.ws.Service class. Also
these EndpointReference objects can appear as SEI method parameters or
return type and can be passed across the applications.

A port's EndpointReference can be got using its
javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider's getEndpointReference method.
Occasionally, it is necessary for one application component to create an
EndpointReference for another web service endpoint. The
W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder class provides a standard API for creating
W3CEndpointReference instances for web service endpoints. When creating
a W3CEndpointReference for an endpoint published by the same Java EE
application, a JAX-WS runtime must fill the address(if not set by the
application) of the endpoint using its service and port names.

==== Respect Binding Support

The javax.xml.ws.RespectBinding annotation or its corresponding
javax.xml.ws.RespectBindingFeature web service feature is used to
control whether a JAX-WS implementation must respect/honor the contents
of the wsdl:binding in the WSDL that is associated with the service. See
6.5.3 and 7.14.3 sections in JAX-WS 2.2 specification.

RespectBinding web service feature on the client can be enabled or
disabled by any one of the following ways:

== [#anchor-10]##[#anchor-9]##[#anchor-35]##Server Programming Model

This chapter defines the server programming model for Web Services for
Java EE. A WSDL document defines the interoperability of Web services
and includes the specification of transport and wire format
requirements. In general, WSDL places no requirement on the programming
model of the client or the server. Web Services for Java EE defines two
methods of implementing a Web service. It requires the JAX-RPC Servlet
container based Java class programming model for implementing Web
services that run in the web container and it requires the Stateless
Session EJB programming model for implementing Web services that run in
the EJB container. With JAX-WS, the Servlet based programming model for
implementing Web Services is similar to one defined by JAX-RPC. These
two implementation methods provide a means for defining a Port component
to bring portable applications into the Web Services programming
paradigm. This specification also requires that a developer be able to
start simple and grow up to use more complex qualities of service. The
following sections define the requirements for Port components.

=== Goals

Port components address the following goals:

* Provide a portable Web services programming model
* Provide a server programming model which maintains a consistent client
view. The client must not be required to know how the service is
implemented.
* Provide path to start simple and grow to more complex run-time service
requirements
* Leverage existing Java EE container functionality
* Leverage familiar programming models

=== Concepts

A Port component (sometimes referred to as Port) defines the server view
of a Web service. Each Port services a location defined by the WSDL port
address. A Port component services the operation requests defined by a
WSDL PortType. JAX-RPC requires that every Port component has a Service
Endpoint Interface and a Service Implementation Bean. JAX-WS along with
JSR-181 mandates the existence of javax.jws.WebService annotated Service
Implementation Bean in a Port component. Service Implementation Bean may
optionally reference a Service Endpoint Interface but is not required to
do so. The Service Endpoint Interface is a Java mapping of the WSDL
PortType and binding associated with a WSDL port. The Service
Implementation Bean can vary based on the container the Port is deployed
in, but in general it is a Java class which may implement the methods
defined by the Service Endpoint Interface. WSDL ports, which differ only
in address, are mapped to separate Port components, each with its own
potentially unique but probably shared Service Implementation Bean.
link:#anchor-36[Figure 5] illustrates this below.

{empty}[#anchor-37]##[#anchor-38]##image:5.png[image,width=374,height=259]

* [#anchor-36]##Figure 5 container

A Port’s life cycle is specific to and completely controlled by the
container, but in general follows the same life cycle of the container
itself. A Port is created and initialized by the container before the
first request received at the WSDL port address can be serviced. A Port
is destroyed by the container whenever the container feels it is
necessary to do so, such as when the container is shutting down.

The implementation of a Port and the container it runs in are tied. A
JAX-RPC Service Implementation Bean always runs in a web container. A
JAX-WS Service Implementation Bean may also run in a web container. An
EJB Service Implementation Bean always runs in an EJB container.

The Port component associates a WSDL port address with a Service
Implementation Bean. In general the Port component defers container
service requirement definition to the Java EE component’s deployment
descriptor. This is discussed further in Chapters link:#anchor-39[6.3]
and link:#anchor-40[7.3]. A container provides a listener for the WSDL
port address and a means of dispatching the request to the Service
Implementation. A container also provides run-time services such as
security constraints and logical to physical mappings for references to
distributed objects and resources.

=== Port Component Model Specification

A Port component defines the programming model artifacts that make the
Web Service a portable server application. The association of a Port
component with a WSDL port provides for interoperability. The
programming model artifacts include:

WSDL document – Although not strictly a programming model artifact, the
WSDL document provides a canonical description of a Web service that may
be published to third parties. A WSDL document and the Service Endpoint
Interface are related by the JAX-RPC/JAX-WS WSDL<->Java mapping rules.

Service Endpoint Interface (SEI) - This interface defines the methods
that are implemented by the Service Implementation Bean.

Service Implementation Bean - The Service Implementation Bean is a Java
class that provides the business logic of the Web service. In addition,
it defines the Port component contract for the container, which allows
the business logic to interact with container services. It implements
the same methods and signatures of the SEI, but is not required to
implement the SEI itself.

Security Role References - The Port may declare logical role names in
the deployment descriptor. These logical role names are reconciled
across the modules by the assembler and mapped to physical roles at
deployment time and allow the service to provide instance level security
checks.

____
____

A developer declares a Port component within a Web services deployment
descriptor. The deployment descriptor includes the WSDL document that
describes the PortType and binding of the Web service. When using
JAX-WS, a developer is not required to have a Web services deployment
descriptor . Most of the information in the deployment descriptor is
captured in the annotated Service Implementation Bean. A deployment
descriptor may be used to override or enhance the information provided
in the Service Implementation Bean annotation. A deployer and the deploy
tool handles the mapping of the Port into a container.

==== [#anchor-41]##[#anchor-42]##Service Endpoint Interface

The Service Endpoint Interface (SEI) must follow the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
rules for WSDL<->Java mapping. The SEI is related to the WSDL PortType
and WSDL bindings by these rules.

When JAX-RPC is used, the SEI is required for use by the deployment
tools and parallel client development. The Port component developer is
responsible for providing both the WSDL document with a minimum of the
PortType and binding defined and the SEI and for keeping the two in sync
with each other.

When JAX-WS is used, the SEI may be required for client side development
only. The Port component developer is not required to provide the SEI or
the WSDL document.

==== Service Implementation Bean

A service implementation bean for a web service can be implemented as
follows:

* A JAX-RPC or JAX-WS service endpoint running in a web container
* Stateless Session EJB as a JAX-RPC or JAX-WS web service
* Singleton Session EJB as a JAX-WS web service

The programming models are fully defined in sections
link:#anchor-43[5.3.2.3] and link:#anchor-44[5.3.2.4].

A container may use any bean instance to service request.

In a product that also supports JSR-299, an implementation must support
use of 299-style managed beans as JAX-WS web service classes in an
application. JAX-WS annotations may be directly applied to these beans.
JSR-299 specifies the requirements for these container-managed bean
instances w.r.t instantiation, injection and other services. JSR-299
defines @Dependent pseudo-scope, web service classes must be in that
scope. Additionally, a JAX-WS service using singleton session EJB can
also be in @ApplicationScoped scope. It is an error if the service class
has a scope other than the required one.

In a product that also supports Managed Beans, an implementation must
support use of managed beans as JAX-WS web service classes in an
application. JAX-WS annotations may be directly applied to managed
beans. Managed Beans specification specifies the requirements for these
container-managed bean instances w.r.t instantiation, injection and
other services.

JAX-WS along with JSR-181 places additional requirements on Service
Implementation Beans detailed in sections 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2.

The developer is only required to provide the javax.jws.WebService
annotated Service Implementation Bean. The deployment tools could then
be used to generate the WSDL document and the SEI using JAX-WS rules for
Java <-> WSDL mapping.

===== _javax.jws.WebService_ annotation

JAX-WS along with JSR-181 requires that the Service Implementation Beans
must include javax.jws.WebService class-level annotation to indicate
that it implements a Web Service. Detail requirements and definition of
the javax.jws.WebService annotation can be found in JSR-181
specification (section 4.1). If member attributes of the annotation are
not specified then server side deployment descriptors (see section 7.1)
are used. The member attributes of the annotation can also be overridden
by server side deployment descriptors .

A Service Implementation Bean using this annotation is not required to
specify a wsdlLocation. If wsdlLocation attribute is specified in the
javax.jws.WebService annotation, it must follow the packaging rules for
the WSDL file detailed in section 5.4. If wsdlLocation attribute is
specified, then the WSDL file must exist at that location or can be
resolved using the catalog facility specified in section 5.4.4.

The following table shows the relationship between the deployment
descriptor elements and this annotation.

Table 1 Relationship between the deployment descriptor elements and
javax.jws.WebService annotation

[cols=",",]
|===
|<webservices>/<webservice-description> |One per WSDL document

|<webservices>/<webservice-description>/<port-component> |One per
@WebService annotation

|<webservices>/<webservice-description>/<webservice-description-name>
|This is implementation specific

|<webservices>/<webservice-description>/<wsdl-file>
|@WebService.wsdlLocation

|<webservices>/<webservice-description>/<port-component>/<port-component-name>
a|
@WebService.name (if not specified then its default value as specified
in JSR-181), only if it is unique in the module

If the above is not unique then fully qualified name of the Bean class
is used to guarantee uniqueness

|@WebService.serviceName

|<webservices>/<webservice-description>/<port-component>/<wsdl-port>
|@WebService.portName

|<webservices>/<webservice-description>/<port-component>/<service-endpoint-interface>
|@WebService.endpointInterface
|===

For Stateless or Singleton Session EJBs using this annotation, the name
attribute of the javax.ejb.Stateless or javax.ejb.Singleton annotation
on the Service Implementation Bean class must be used as the <ejb-link>
element in the deployment descriptor to map the Port component to the
actual EJB. If name attribute in javax.ejb.Stateless or
javax.ejb.Singleton annotation is not specified, then the default value
is used as defined in the section 4.4.1 of EJB 3.1.

For Servlet based endpoints using this annotation, fully qualified name
of the Service Implementation Bean class must be used as the
<servlet-link> element in the deployment descriptor to map the Port
component to the actual Servlet.

Following default mapping rules apply for Web modules that contain
Servlet based endpoints that use this annotation but do not package a
web.xml or a partial web.xml:

* fully qualified name of the Service Implementation Bean class maps to
<servlet-name> element in web.xml.
* fully qualified name of the Service Implementation Bean class maps to
<servlet-class> element in web.xml (also specified in section 7.1.2)
* serviceName attribute of javax.jws.WebService annotation prefixed with
"/" maps to <url-pattern> element in web.xml. If the serviceName
attribute in javax.jws.WebService annotation is not specified, then the
default value as specified in JSR-181 specification is used.

The <service-endpoint-interface> element in the deployment descriptor
for an implementation bean must match @WebService.endpointInterface
member attribute if it is specified for the bean. Any other value is
ignored.

If <wsdl-service> element is provided in the deployment descriptor, then
the namespace used in this element overrides the targetNamespace member
attribute in this annotation. The namespace in <wsdl-port> element if
specified, must match the effective target namespace.

javax.jws.WebService annotated Service Implementation Beans can be run
either as a Stateless or Singleton Session EJB in an EJB container or as
a JAX-WS service endpoint in a web container. The two programming models
are fully defined in sections link:#anchor-43[5.3.2.3] and
link:#anchor-44[5.3.2.4].

===== javax.xml.ws.Provider interface and _javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider_ annotation

Service Endpoint Interfaces (SEI) provides a high level Java-centric
abstraction that hides the details of converting between Java objects
and their XML representations for use in XML-based messages. However, in
some cases it is desirable for services to be able to operate at the XML
message level. The javax.xml.ws.Provider interface in JAX-WS (section
5.1) offers an alternative to SEIs and may be implemented by Service
Implementation Beans wishing to work at the XML message level.

JAX-WS requires that these Service Implementation Beans must include
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider annotation on the class, indicating that
it implements the javax.xml.ws.Provider interface. Details on the
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider annotation can be found in JAX-WS
specification (section 7.7). If member attributes of the annotation are
not specified then server side deployment descriptors (see section 7.1)
are used. The member attributes of the annotation can also be overridden
by server side deployment descriptors .

. A WSDL file is required to be packaged with a Provider implementation.
If wsdlLocation attribute is specified in the
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider annotation, it must follow the packaging
rules detailed in section 5.4. If wsdlLocation attribute is specified,
then the WSDL file must exist at that location or can be resolved using
the catalog facility specified in section 5.4.4.

The following table shows the relationship between the deployment
descriptor elements and this annotation.

javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider annotation

|This deployment descriptor is not required to be specified for Service
Implementation Beans that are annotated with @WebServiceProvider
|===

For Stateless or Singleton Session EJBs using this annotation, the name
attribute of the javax.ejb.Stateless or javax.ejb.Singleton annotation
on the Service Implementation Bean class must be used as the <ejb-link>
element in the deployment descriptor to map the Port component to the
actual EJB. If name attribute in javax.ejb.Stateless or
javax.ejb.Singleton annotation is not specified, then the default value
is used as defined in the section 4.4.1 of EJB 3.1.

For Servlet based endpoints using this annotation, fully qualified name
of the Service Implementation Bean class must be used as the
<servlet-link> element in the deployment descriptor to map the Port
component to the actual Servlet.

Following default mapping rules apply for Web modules that contain
Servlet based endpoints that use this annotation but do not package a
web.xml or a partial web.xml:

* fully qualified name of the Service Implementation Bean class maps to
<servlet-name> element in web.xml.
* fully qualified name of the Service Implementation Bean class maps to
<servlet-class> element in web.xml. (also specified in section 7.1.2)
* serviceName attribute of javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider annotation
prefixed with "/" maps to <url-pattern> element in web.xml.

If <wsdl-service> element is provided in the deployment descriptor, then
the namespace used in this element overrides the targetNamespace member
attribute in this annotation. The namespace in <wsdl-port> element if
specified, must match the effective target namespace.

javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider annotated Service Implementation Beans
can be run either as a Stateless or Singleton Session EJB in an EJB
container or as a JAX-WS service endpoint in a web container. The two
programming models are fully defined in sections
link:#anchor-43[5.3.2.3] and link:#anchor-44[5.3.2.4].

===== [#anchor-43]##[#anchor-45]##EJB container programming model

A Stateless Session Bean, as defined by the Enterprise JavaBeans
specification, can be used to implement a Web service to be deployed in
the EJB container. A Singleton Session Bean, as defined by the EJB 3.1
specification, can be used to implement a JAX-WS Web service to be
deployed in the EJB container.

A Stateless Session Bean does not have to worry about multi-threaded
access. The EJB container is required to serialize request flow through
any particular instance of a Service Implementation Bean. A Singleton
Session Bean is intended to be shared and supports concurrent access.
The access rules are specified in the 4.8.5 section of EJB 3.1.

The requirements for creating a Service Implementation Bean as a
Stateless or Singleton Session EJB are repeated in part here.

* With JAX-WS, the Service Implementation Bean class must be annotated
with either javax.jws.WebService or javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider
annotation. See section 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2
* For developers starting from Java using JAX-WS, javax.jws.WebService
annotation on Service Implementation Bean may optionally reference an
SEI but is not required to do so. If SEI is not specified, the Service
Implementation Bean class implicitly defines a SEI as required by
section 3.3 of JAX-WS specification. The Service Implementation Bean
methods are not required to throw javax.rmi.RemoteException. The
business methods of the bean must be public and must not be final or
static. Only those methods that are annotated with @WebMethod in the
Service Implementation Bean, are exposed to the client.
* For developers starting from WSDL using JAX-WS, the SEI generated from
the WSDL must be annotated with javax.jws.WebService annotation. Refer
to section 2.2 of JAX-WS specification. The Service Implementation Bean
must be annotated with javax.jws.WebService annotation and the
endpointInterface member attribute must refer to this generated SEI.
Service Implementation Bean may implement the Service Endpoint
Interface, but it is not required to do so. The bean must implement all
the method signatures of the SEI. The Service Implementation Bean
methods are not required to throw javax.rmi.RemoteException. The
business methods of the bean must be public and must not be final or
static. It may implement other methods in addition to those defined by
the SEI.
* The Service Implementation Bean must have a default public
constructor.
* When JAX-RPC is used, the Service Implementation Bean may implement
the Service Endpoint Interface, but it is not required to do so. The
bean must implement all the method signatures of the SEI. The Service
Implementation Bean methods are not required to throw
javax.rmi.RemoteException. The business methods of the bean must be
public and must not be final or static. It may implement other methods
in addition to those defined by the SEI.
* A Service Implementation Bean of a Stateless EJB must be a stateless
object. A Service Implementation Bean must not save client specific
state across method calls either within the bean instance’s data members
or external to the instance.
* A Service Implementation Bean of Singleton EJB can have a shared
state. The singleton session bean instance lives for the duration of the
application in which it is created. It maintains its state between
client invocations.
* The class must be public, must not be final and must not be abstract.
* The class must not define the finalize() method.
* Currently, it may use javax.annotation.PostConstruct or
javax.annotation.PreDestroy annotation on methods for lifecycle event
callbacks. See Enterprise JavaBeans specification section 4.1.4 and 10.7
for more details on this.

====== javax.ejb.Stateless annotation

Currently, a Stateless Session Bean must be annotated with the
_javax.ejb.Stateless_ annotation or denoted in the deployment descriptor
as a stateless session bean. The bean class no longer implements the
_javax.ejb.SessionBean_ interface.

The full requirements for Stateless Session Bean are defined in the
Enterprise JavaBeans specification (EJB Core Contracts and Requirements)
section 4.1

====== Allowed access to container services

The Enterprise JavaBeans specification (EJB Core Contracts and
Requirements) section 4.4.1 defines the allowed container service access
requirements.

A stateless session bean that implements a web service endpoint using
the JAX-RPC APIs access the JAX-RPC javax.xml.rpc.handler.MessageContext
interface by means of the SessionContext.getMessageContext method. Refer
to section 4.3.6 of the Enterprise JavaBeans specification (EJB Core
Contracts and Requirements)

A stateless or singleton session bean that implements a web service
endpoint using the JAX-WS APIs should use the
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceContext, which can be injected by use of the
@Resource annotation (see section 2.2 of JSR-250 Common Annotations for
Java Platform specification), to access message context and security
information relative to the request being served. The WebServiceContext
interface allows the stateless or singleton session bean instance to get
access to the javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext. Usage of a
WebServiceContext must meet the requirements defined by the JAX-WS
specification section 5.3.

====== javax.ejb.Singleton annotation

EJB 3.1 introduces Singleton session bean component that provides an
easy access to shared state. A Singleton session bean is instantiated
once per application. A Singleton session bean must be annotated with
the _javax.ejb.Singleton_ annotation or denoted in the deployment
descriptor as a singleton session bean.

The full requirements for Singleton Session Bean are defined in the
section 4.8 of EJB 3.1 specification.

===== [#anchor-46]##[#anchor-44]##Web container programming model

====== Web container programming model for JAX-RPC

The term JAX-RPC Service Endpoint used within the JAX-RPC specification
is somewhat confusing since both Service Implementation Beans require
the use of a JAX-RPC run time. However, in this case it refers to the
programming model defined within the JAX-RPC specification that is used
to create Web services that run within the web container. The
requirements are repeated here with clarification. Changes from the
JAX-RPC defined programming model are required for running in a Java EE
container-managed environment.

A JAX-RPC Service Endpoint can be single or multi-threaded. The
concurrency requirement is declared as part of the programming model. A
JAX-RPC Service Endpoint must implement javax.servlet.SingleThreadModel
if single threaded access is required by the component. A container must
serialize method requests for a Service Implementation Bean that
implements the SingleThreadModel interface. Note, the SingleThreadModel
interface has been deprecated in the Servlet 2.4 specification.

The Service Implementation Bean must follow the Service Developer
requirements outlined in the JAX-RPC specification and are listed below
except as noted.

* The Service Implementation Bean must have a default public
constructor.

* The Service Implementation Bean may implement the Service Endpoint
Interface as defined by the JAX-RPC Servlet model. The bean must
implement all the method signatures of the SEI. In addition, a Service
Implementation Bean may be implemented that does not implement the SEI.
This additional requirement provides the same SEI implementation
flexibility as provided by EJB service endpoints. The business methods
of the bean must be public and must not be static. If the Service
Implementation Bean does not implement the SEI, the business methods
must not be final. The Service Implementation Bean may implement other
methods in addition to those defined by the SEI, but only the SEI
methods are exposed to the client.

* A Service Implementation must be a stateless object. A Service
Implementation Bean must not save client specific state across method
calls either within the bean instance’s data members or external to the
instance. A container may use any bean instance to service a request.

* The class must be public, must not be final and must not be abstract.
* The class must not define the finalize() method.

======= The optional ServiceLifecycle Interface

A Service Implementation Bean for the web container may implement the
java.xml.rpc.server.ServiceLifeCycle interface:

package javax.xml.rpc.server;

public interface *ServiceLifecycle *\{

void init(Object context) throws ServiceException;

void destroy();

}

The ServiceLifeCycle interface allows the web container to notify a
Service Implementation Bean instance of impending changes in its state.
The bean may use the notification to prepare its internal state for the
transition. If the bean implements the ServiceLifeCycle interface, the
container is required to call the init and destroy methods as described
below.

The container must call the init method before it can start dispatching
requests to the SEI methods of the bean. The init method parameter value
provided by the container is described by the JAX-RPC specification. The
bean may use the container notification to ready its internal state for
receiving requests.

The container must notify the bean of its intent to remove the bean
instance from the container’s working set by calling the destroy method.
A container may not call the destroy method while a request is being
processed by the bean instance. The container may not dispatch
additional requests to the SEI methods of the bean after the destroy
method is called.

======= [#anchor-47]##Allowed access to container services

The container provides certain services based on the life cycle state of
the Service Implementation Bean. Access to services provided by a web
container in a Java EE environment (e.g. transactions, JNDI access to
the component’s environment, etc.) must follow the requirements defined
by the Servlet and Java EE specifications. Access to a
ServletEndpointContext must meet the requirements defined by the JAX-RPC
specification section 10.1.3.

====== Web container programming model for JAX-WS

JAX-WS Service Endpoint that run within the web container must follow
the requirements repeated here.

A JAX-WS Service Endpoint can be single or multi-threaded. A JAX-WS
Service Endpoint must implement javax.servlet.SingleThreadModel if
single threaded access is required by the component. A container must
serialize method requests for a Service Implementation Bean that
implements the SingleThreadModel interface. Note, the SingleThreadModel
interface has been deprecated in the Servlet 2.4 specification.

The Service Implementation Bean must follow these requirements:

* The Service Implementation Bean class must be annotated with either
javax.jws.WebService or javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider annotation. See
section 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2
* For developers starting from Java using JAX-WS, javax.jws.WebService
annotation on Service Implementation Bean may optionally reference an
SEI but is not required to do so. If SEI is not specified, the Service
Implementation Bean class implicitly defines a SEI as required by
section 3.3 of JAX-WS specification. The business methods of the bean
must be public and must not be final or static. Only those methods that
are annotated with @WebMethod in the Service Implementation Bean, are
exposed to the client.
* For developers starting from WSDL using JAX-WS, the SEI generated from
the WSDL must be annotated with javax.jws.WebService annotation. Refer
to section 2.2 of JAX-WS specification. The Service Implementation Bean
must be annotated with javax.jws.WebService annotation and the
endpointInterface member attribute must refer to this generated SEI.
Service Implementation Bean may implement the Service Endpoint
Interface, but it is not required to do so. The bean must implement all
the method signatures of the SEI. The business methods of the bean must
be public and must not be final or static. It may implement other
methods in addition to those defined by the SEI.
* The Service Implementation Bean must have a default public
constructor.

* A Service Implementation must be a stateless object. A Service
Implementation Bean must not save client specific state across method
calls either within the bean instance’s data members or external to the
instance. A container may use any bean instance to service a request.
* The class must be public, must not be final and must not be abstract.
* The class must not define the finalize() method.

======= The optional @PostConstruct or @PreDestroy annotations

A Service Implementation Bean may use javax.annotation.PostConstruct or
javax.annotation.PreDestroy annotation on methods for lifecycle event
callbacks.

The methods annotated with javax.annotation.PostConstruct or
javax.annotation.PreDestroy annotation allow the web container to notify
a Service Implementation Bean instance of impending changes in its
state. The bean may use the notification to prepare its internal state
for the transition. If the bean implements methods that are annotated
with javax.annotation.PostConstruct or javax.annotation.PreDestroy
annotations then the container is required to call them in the manner
described below.

The container must call the method annotated with
javax.annotation.PostConstruct before it can start dispatching requests
to the methods exposed as Web Service operations of the bean. The bean
may use the container notification to ready its internal state for
receiving requests.

The container must notify the bean of its intent to remove the bean
instance from the container’s working set by calling the method
annotated with javax.annotation.PreDestroy annotation. A container may
not call this method while a request is being processed by the bean
instance. The container may not dispatch additional requests to the
methods exposed as Web Service operations of the bean after this method
is called.

======= [#anchor-48]##Allowed access to container services

The container provides certain services based on the life cycle state of
the Service Implementation Bean. Access to services provided by a web
container in a Java EE environment (e.g. transactions, JNDI access to
the component’s environment, etc.) must follow the requirements defined
by the Servlet and Java EE specifications.

A Servlet that implements a web service endpoint using the JAX-WS APIs
should use the javax.xml.ws.WebServiceContext, which can be injected by
use of the @Resource annotation (see section 2.2 of JSR-250 Common
Annotations for Java Platform specification), to access message context
and security information relative to the request being served.Usage of a
WebServiceContext must meet the requirements defined by the JAX-WS
specification section 5.3. At runtime, the methods in WebServiceContext
serve the same purpose as the methods with the same name defined in
ServletEndpointContext in JAX-RPC or
javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest. Service Implementation Beans can
get access to HTTPSession and ServletContext using table 9.4 of section
9.4.1.1 of JAX-WS specification.

==== Publishing Endpoints – javax.xml.ws.Endpoint

JAX-WS provides functionality for creating and publishing Web Service
endpoints dynamically using javax.xml.ws.Endpoint API. The use of this
functionality is considered non-portable in a managed environment. It is
required that both the Servlet and the EJB container disallow the
publishing of the Endpoint dynamically, by not granting the
publishEndpoint security permission. Please refer to details on this in
Section 5.2 of the JAX-WS specification.

==== Service Implementation Bean Life Cycle

The life cycle of a Service Implementation Bean is controlled by the
container and is illustrated in link:#anchor-49[Figure 6]. The methods
called by the container are container/bean specific, but in general are
quite similar. link:#anchor-49[Figure 6] illustrates the life cycle in
the web container. The EJB container life cycle can be referenced from
Enterprise JavaBeans specification section 4.3.

The container services requests defined by a WSDL port. It does this by
creating a listener for the WSDL port address, receiving requests and
dispatching them on a Service Implementation Bean. Before a request can
be serviced, the container must instantiate a Service Implementation
Bean and ready it for method requests.

A container readies a bean instance by first calling newInstance on the
Service Implementation Bean class to create an instance. The container
then calls the life cycle methods on the Service Implementation Bean
that are specific to the container. For the web container with JAX-RPC
runtime, it calls the init method on the instance if the Service
Implementation Bean class implements the ServiceLifecycle interface. For
web containers with JAX-WS runtime, it calls the method annotated with
javax.annotation.PostConstruct annotation. For the EJB container, it
calls the method annotated with javax.annotation.PostConstruct
annotation . The javax.annotation.PostConstruct callback occurs after
any dependency injection has been performed by the container and before
the first business method invocation on the bean.

A Service Implementation Bean instance has no identity.

A container may pool method ready instances of a Service Implementation
Bean and dispatch a method request on any instance in a method ready
state.

The container notifies a Service Implementation Bean instance that it is
about to be removed from Method Ready state by calling container/bean
specific life cycle methods on the instance. For the web container with
JAX-RPC runtime, the destroy method is called. For the web container
with JAX-WS runtime, the method annotated with
javax.annotation.PreDestroy is called. For the EJB container, the method
annotated with javax.annotation.PreDestroy is called.

==== JAX-RPC Custom Serializers / Deserializers

The use of JAX-RPC custom serializers / deserializers is out of scope
for this version of the specification. JAX-RPC customer serializers /
deserializers are not portable across Web Services for Java EE providers
and are therefore not included as part of the portable deployment unit.
It is expected that vendors will provide proprietary solutions to this
problem until it has been addressed by a future version of JAX-RPC.

==== Protocol Binding and javax.xml.ws.BindingType annotation

JAX-WS specification requires that a developer be able to specify the
protocol binding on a Web Service endpoint by using
javax.xml.ws.BindingType annotation. JAX-WS also requires support for
the following protocol bindings:

* SOAP1.2 over HTTP - SOAP1.2/HTTP
* SOAP1.1 over HTTP - SOAP1.1/HTTP
* XML over HTTP - XML/HTTP
* SOAP1.1 over HTTP with MTOM enabled
* SOAP1.2 over HTTP with MTOM enabled

Support for overriding the protocol binding specified by BindingType
annotation is provided by <protocol-binding> deployment descriptor
element for a port component. Refer to section 7.1.2 for details on this
deployment descriptor element.

In the event this element is not specified in the deployment descriptors
and no BindingType annotation is used, the default binding is used for
the endpoint (SOAP1.1/HTTP).

==== MTOM/XOP support

JAX-WS compliant implementations are required to support MTOM (Message
Transmission Optimization Mechanism)/XOP (XML-binary Optimized
Packaging) specifications from W3C. Refer to sections 6.5.2, 7.14.2, and
10.4.1.1 of JAX-WS specification. Support for SOAP MTOM/XOP mechanism
for optimizing transmission of binary data types is provided by JAXB
which is the data binding for JAX-WS. JAX-WS provides the MIME
processing required to enable JAXB to serialize and deserialize MIME
based MTOM/XOP packages.

SOAP MTOM/XOP mechanism on the service can be enabled or disabled by any
one of the following ways:

* Using <port-component>/<enable-mtom> deployment descriptor element for
a corresponding service
* Using @MTOM with a @WebService that creates a service

Deployment descriptor mtom elements override the @MTOM annotation for a
corresponding service. These elements also override if MTOM enabled
protocol binding is used. In other words, if MTOM enabled protocol
binding is used along with <enable-mtom> set to false, then this feature
is disabled. This deployment descriptor must be specified in order to be
applied to the protocol binding to enable or disable MTOM. Note that
JAX-WS recommends the use of MTOM feature instead of mtom enabled
bindings: SOAPBinding.SOAP11HTTP_MTOM_BINDING,
SOAPBinding.SOAP12HTTP_MTOM_BINDING.

[cols=",",]
|===
|<service>/<port-component>/<enable-mtom> |@MTOM.enabled
|<service>/<port-component>/<mtom-threshold> |@MTOM.threshold
|===

==== Web Services Addressing support

JAX-WS services are required to support Web Services Addressing 1.0 -
Core, Web Services Addressing 1.0 - Soap Binding, and Web Services
Addressing 1.0 - Metadata.

Web Service Addressing requirements for a service can be specified by
any one of the following ways:

* Using <port-component>/<addressing> deployment descriptor element for
the corresponding service
* Using @Addressing annotation with the service implementation class
* If the service uses WSDL description, the addressing requirements can
be specified in the WSDL as per the WS-Addressing 1.0 - Metadata
specification.
+
The above order also defines a precedence order for the addressing
requirements. For example, the addressing requirements specified by the
@Addressing are overridden by the same from a corresponding
<port-component>/<addressing> deployment descriptor element.

and@Addressing

|<service>/<port-component>/<addressing>/<enabled> |@Addressing.enabled

|<service>/<port-component>/<addressing>/<required>
|@Addressing.required

|<service>/<port-component>/<addressing>/<responses>
|@Addressing.responses
|===

A service's EndpointReference can be got using WebServiceContext's
getEndpointReference method during service invocation. Occasionally, it
is necessary for one application component to create an
EndpointReference for another web service endpoint. The
W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder class provides a standard API for creating
W3CEndpointReference instances for web service endpoints. When creating
a W3CEndpointReference for an endpoint published by the same Java EE
application, a JAX-WS runtime must fill the address(if not set by the
application) of the endpoint using its service and port names.

==== RespectBinding support

The javax.xml.ws.RespectBinding annotation or its corresponding
javax.xml.ws.RespectBindingFeature web service feature is used to
control whether a JAX-WS implementation must respect/honor the contents
of the wsdl:binding in the WSDL that is associated with the service. See
6.5.3 and 7.14.3 sections in JAX-WS 2.2 specification.

RespectBinding web service feature on a service can be enabled or
disabled by any one of the following ways:

* Using <port-component>/<respect-binding> deployment descriptor element
for the corresponding service
* Using @RespectBinding annotation with the service implementation class
+
Deployment descriptor <respect-binding> element overrides the
@RespectBinding annotation for the corresponding service.

=== [#anchor-51]##[#anchor-11]##[#anchor-12]##Packaging 

Port components may be packaged in a WAR file, or EJB JAR file. Port
components packaged in a WAR file must use a JAX-RPC/JAX-WS Service
Endpoint or a Stateless/Singleton session bean as a JAX-WS Service
Endpoint for the Service Implementation Bean. Port components packaged
in a EJB-JAR file must use a Stateless or Singleton Session Bean for the
Service Implementation Bean.

The developer is responsible for packaging, either by containment or
reference, the WSDL file (not required with JAX-WS when annotations are
used), Service Endpoint Interface class (optional with JAX-WS), Service
Implementation Bean class, and their dependent classes, JAX-WS generated
portable artifacts, JAX-RPC mapping file (not required with JAX-WS and
ignored if specified) along with a Web services deployment descriptor
(not required with JAX-WS when annotations are used) in a Java EE
module. The location of the Web services deployment descriptor in the
module is module specific. WSDL files are located relative to the root
of the module and are typically located in the wsdl directory that is
co-located with the module deployment descriptor or a subdirectory of
it. Mapping files (not required with JAX-WS and ignored if specified)
are located relative to the root of the module and are typically
co-located with the WSDL file. JAX-WS generated portable artifacts (when
starting from Java) include zero or more JavaBean classes to aide in
marshaling of method invocations and responses, as well as
service-specific exceptions.

Annotated JAX-WS components may be mixed with deployment descriptor
based JAX-RPC components in a module. It is not required that JAX-WS
components have a deployment descriptor entry in such cases. However,
all port components in a module that are classified under the same
<webservice-description> element in the deployment descriptor, must be
based on the same runtime (either JAX-RPC or JAX-WS).

==== [#anchor-52]##The wsdl directory

The wsdl directory is a well-known location that contains WSDL files and
any relative content the WSDL files may reference. WSDL files and their
relative references will be published during deployment. See sections
link:#anchor-53[8.2.4] and link:#anchor-54[8.2.5] for more details.

==== [#anchor-55]##EJB Module Packaging

Stateless or Singleton Session EJB Service Implementation Beans are
packaged in an EJB-JAR that contains the class files and WSDL files. The
packaging rules follow those defined by the Enterprise JavaBeans
specification. In addition, the Web services deployment descriptor
location within the EJB-JAR file is META-INF/webservices.xml. The wsdl
directory is located at META-INF/wsdl. See 5.4.3 section for packaging
Stateless or Singleton session beans in a WAR file.

==== [#anchor-56]##Web App Module Packaging

JAX-RPC/JAX-WS Service Endpoints and Stateless/Singleton EJB as JAX-WS
Service endpoints can be packaged in a WAR file that contains the class
files and WSDL files. The packaging rules for the WAR file are those
defined by the Servlet specification. The packaging rules for Stateless
or Singleton EJB within a WAR are defined by the EJB specification. In
addition, a Web services deployment descriptor is located in a WAR at
WEB-INF/webservices.xml and the wsdl directory is located at
WEB-INF/wsdl.

==== Catalog packaging

JAX-WS requires support for a OASIS XML Catalogs 1.1 specification to be
used when resolving any Web service document that is part of the
description of a Web service, specifically WSDL and XML Schema
documents. Refer to section 4.4 of JAX-WS specification. The catalog
file jax-ws-catalog.xml must be co-located with the module deployment
descriptor (WEB-INF/jax-ws-catalog.xml for web modules and
META-INF/jax-ws-catalog.xml for EJB modules).

==== Assembly within an EAR file

Assembly of modules containing port components into an EAR file follows
the requirements defined by the Java EE specification.

=== Transactions

The methods of a Service Implementation Bean run under a transaction
context specific to the container. The web container runs the methods
under an unspecified transaction context. The EJB container runs the
methods under the transaction context defined by the
container-transaction element of the EJB deployment descriptor or
javax.ejb.TransactionAttribute annotation.

=== [#anchor-57]##Container Provider Responsibilities

In addition to the container requirements described above a container
provider must provide a JAX-RPC or JAX-WS runtime.

It is the responsibility of the container provider to support processing
JAX-RPC or JAX-WS compliant requests and invoking Ports as described
above. The application server must support deployment of these Ports.
This specification prescribes the use of the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
Java<->WSDL and Java<->XML Serialization framework for all XML Protocol
based Web service bindings. For JAX-RPC or JAX-WS inbound messages, the
container will act as the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS server side runtime. It is
responsible for:

[arabic]
. Listening on a well known port or on the URI of the Web service
implementation (as defined in the service’s WSDL after deployment) for
SOAP/HTTP bindings.
. Parsing the inbound message according to the Service binding.
. Mapping the message to the implementation class and method according
to the Service deployment data.
. Creating the appropriate Java objects from the SOAP envelope according
to the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS specification.
. Invoking the Service Implementation Bean handlers and instance method
with the appropriate Java parameters.
. Capturing the response to the invocation if the style is
request-response
. Mapping the Java response objects into SOAP message according to the
JAX-RPC or JAX-WS specification.
. Creating the message envelope appropriate for the transport
. Sending the message to the originating Web service client.

This chapter defines the programming model for handlers in Web Services
for Java EE. Handlers define a means for an application to access the
raw message of a request. This access is provided on both the client and
server. Handlers are not part of the WSDL specification and are
therefore not described in it. See section link:#anchor-39[6.3] for
declaration of handlers within deployment descriptors. The JAX-RPC
specification defines the Handler APIs in chapter 12. The JAX-WS
specification defines the Handler framework in chapter 9. This
specification defines Handler use within a Java EE environment.

=== Concepts

A Handler can be likened to a Servlet Filter in that it is business
logic that can examine and potentially modify a request before it is
processed by a Web Service component. It can also examine and
potentially modify the response after the component has processed the
request. Handlers can also run on the client before the request is sent
to the remote host and after the client receives a response.

JAX-RPC Handlers are specific to SOAP requests only and cannot be used
for other non-SOAP Web services. Handlers may be transport independent.
For instance, a Handler as defined by JAX-RPC may be usable for SOAP/JMS
in addition to SOAP/HTTP if a JMS protocol binding was available.

JAX-WS specification defines Logical Handlers and Protocol Handlers.
Logical Handlers are protocol agnostic and are unable to affect protocol
specific parts of a message. Protocol Handlers operate on message
context properties and protocol specific messages. Protocol handlers are
specific to a particular protocol and may access and change protocol
specific aspects of a message.

Handlers are service specific and therefore associated with a particular
Port component or port of a Service interface. This association is
defined in the deployment descriptors in section link:#anchor-66[7.1]
and link:#anchor-67[7.2] respectively. They are processed in an ordered
fashion called a HandlerChain, which is defined by the deployment
descriptors. JSR-181 defines the javax.jws.HandlerChain annotation,
which can be used with JAX-WS in the implementation code to declare
HandlerChains associated with a Port component or a Service.

There are several scenarios for which Handlers may be considered. These
include application specific SOAP header processing, logging, and
caching. A limited form of encryption is also possible. For application
specific SOAP header processing, it is important to note that the client
and server must agree on the header processing semantics without the aid
of a WSDL description that declares the semantic requirements.
Encryption is limited to a literal binding in which the SOAP message
part maps to a SOAPElement. In this case, a value within the SOAPElement
may be encrypted as long as the encryption of that value does not change
the structure of the SOAPElement.

Some Handler scenarios described within the JAX-RPC specification are
not supported by this specification. For example, auditing cannot be
fully supported because there is no means for a Handler to obtain the
Principal. The secure stock quote example cannot be supported as stated
because encrypting the body would prevent the container from determining
which Port component the request should be directed to and therefore
which Handler should decrypt the body.

A Handler always runs under the execution context of the application
logic. On the client side, the Stub/proxy controls Handler execution.
Client side Handlers run after the Stub/proxy has marshaled the message,
but before container services and the transport binding occurs. Server
side Handlers run after container services have run including method
level authorization, but before demarshalling and dispatching the
message to the endpoint. Handlers can access the java:comp/env context
for accessing resources and environment entries defined by the Port
component the Handler is associated with.

Handlers are constrained by the Java EE managed environment. Handlers
are not able to re-target a request to a different component. Handlers
cannot change the WSDL operation nor can Handlers change the message
part types and number of parts. On the server, Handlers can only
communicate with the business logic of the component using the
MessageContext. On the client, Handlers have no means of communicating
with the business logic of the client. There is no standard means for a
Handler to access the security identity associated with a request,
therefore Handlers cannot portably perform processing based on security
identity.

The life cycle of a Handler is controlled by the container.

Handlers are associated with the Port component on the server and
therefore run in both the web and EJB containers.

Java EE applications that define one or more port components or service
references include WSDL descriptions for each of them as well as
application logic and (optionally) message handlers associated with
them. In order for such applications to behave predictably, all three
elements (description, handlers and application logic) must be well
aligned. Developers should program handlers carefully in order not to
create invalid SOAP envelope format that contradicts WS-I BP 1.0
requirements or violates the message schema declared in the WSDL. In
particular, containers cannot provide any guarantees beyond those
specified as part of the interoperability requirements on the behavior
of an application that violates the assumptions embedded in a WSDL
document either in its business logic or in message handlers.

=== Specification

This section defines the requirements for JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Handlers
running in Web Services for Java EE. Chapter 12 of the JAX-RPC
specification and Chapter 9 of the JAX-WS specification defines the
programming model requirements. Differences between this specification
and the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS specification are noted in boxed paragraphs.

==== Scenarios

Handlers must be able to support the following scenarios:

Scenario 1: Handlers must be able to transform the SOAP header. One
example is the addition of a SOAP header for application specific
information, like customerId, by the handler.

Scenario 2: Handlers must be able to transform just parts of the body.
This might include changing part values within the SOAP body. Encryption
of some parameter values is an example of this scenario.

Scenario 3: Handlers must be able to just read a message where no
additions, transformations, or modification to the message is made.
Common scenarios are logging, metering, and accounting.

==== Programming Model

A Web Services for Java EE provider is required to provide all
interfaces and classes of the javax.xml.rpc.handler package and
javax.xml.ws.handler package. When JAX-RPC is being used, the
HandlerInfo setHandlerConfig() and getHandlerConfig() methods do not
affect the container’s Handler request processing.

A JAX-RPC Web Services for Java EE provider is not required to provide
an implementation of HandlerRegistry. This functionality is specific to
the container.

A JAX-WS Web Services for Java EE provider is required to provide an
implementation of HandlerResolver that returns the Handler Chain with
Handlers specified in the deployment descriptor or the
javax.jws.HandlerChain annotation. The ordering of the Handlers in the
HandlerChain must follow the requirements specified in JAX-WS
specification section 9.2.1.2. In addition to this, the ordering of any
given type of Handler (logical or protocol) in the deployment descriptor
must be maintained

A Web Services for Java EE provider is required to provide an
implementation of MessageContext.

A Web Services for Java EE provider is required to provide all the
interfaces of the javax.xml.rpc.handler.soap and
javax.xml.ws.handler.soap package. The provider must also provide an
implementation of the SOAPMessageContext interface.

The programming model of a Port component can be single-threaded or
multi-threaded as defined in sections link:#anchor-45[5.3.2.3] and
link:#anchor-44[5.3.2.4]. The concurrency of a JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Handler
must match the concurrency of the business logic it is associated with.
Client handlers may need to support multi-threaded execution depending
on the business logic which is accessing the Port.

Handlers must be loaded using the same class loader the application code
was loaded with. The class loading rules follow the rules defined for
the container the Handler is running in.

In a product that also supports JSR-299, an implementation must support
use of 299-style managed beans as JAX-WS handler classes in an
application. JSR-299 specifies the requirements for these
container-managed bean instances w.r.t instantiation, injection and
other services. JSR-299 defines @Dependent pseudo-scope, handler classes
must be specified in that scope. It is an error if the handler class has
a scope other than the required one.

In a product that also supports Managed Beans, an implementation must
support use of managed beans as JAX-WS handler classes in an
application. Managed Beans specification specifies the requirements for
these container-managed bean instances w.r.t instantiation, injection
and other services.

===== Handler Life Cycle with JAX-RPC

The life cycle of a Handler is controlled by the container and is
illustrated in link:#anchor-68[Figure 7].

image:7.png[image,width=301,height=188]

* [#anchor-68]##Figure 7 Handler life cycle

The init and destroy methods of the Handler interface allows the
container to notify a Handler instance of impending changes in its
state. The Handler may use the notification to prepare its internal
state for the transition. The container is required to call the init and
destroy methods as described below.

The container must call the init method before it can start dispatching
requests to the handleRequest(), handleResponse(), and handleFault()
methods of the Handler. The Handler may use the container notification
to ready its internal state for receiving requests.

The container must notify the Handler of its intent to remove the
instance from the container’s working set by calling the destroy method.
A container must not call the destroy method while a request is being
processed by the Handler instance. The container must not dispatch
additional requests to the Handler interface methods after the destroy
method is called.

As defined by JAX-RPC, a RuntimeException (other than
SOAPFaultException) thrown from any method of the Handler results in the
destroy method being invoked and transition to the “Does Not Exist”
state.

Pooling of Handler instances is allowed, but is not required. If Handler
instances are pooled, they must be pooled by Port component. This is
because Handlers may retain non-client specific state across method
calls that are specific to the Port component. For instance, a Handler
may initialize internal data members with Port component specific
environment values. These values may not be consistent when a single
Handler type is associated with multiple Port components. Any pooled
instance of a Port component’s Handler in a Method Ready state may be
used to service the handleRequest(), handleResponse(), and handleFault()
methods. It is not required that the same Handler instance service both
the handleRequest() and handleResponse() or handleFault() method
invocations of any given request.

===== Handler Life Cycle with JAX-WS

With JAX-WS the Handler lifecycle is similar to JAX-RPC illustration
shown in the previous section with the following differences:

* The init() method is now replaced by a method carrying a
javax.annotation.PostConstruct annotation (defined by JSR-250
specification, Section 2.4). This method is only called after all
injections requested by the Handler are completed.
* The destroy() method is replaced by a method carrying a
javax.annotation.PreDestroy annotation (defined by JSR-250
specification, Section 2.5).
* Methods handleRequest() and handleResponse() are replaced by
handleMessage().

The lifecycle methods annotated with javax.annotation.PostConstruct and
javax.annotation.PreDestroy in the Handler implementation allows the
container to notify a Handler instance of impending changes in its
state. Detailed requirements for Handler lifecycle are described in
section 9.3.1 JAX-WS specification. The Handler may use the notification
to prepare its internal state for the transition. The container is
required to call lifecycle methods annotated with
javax.annotation.PostConstruct and javax.annotation.PreDestroy as
described below.

The container must carry out any injections (if any) requested by the
handler, typically via the @Resource annotation (see section 2.2 of
JSR-250 Common Annotations for Java Platform specification). After all
the injections have been carried out, the container must invoke the
method carrying a javax.annotation.PostConstruct annotation. This method
must have a void return type and take zero arguments. The handler
instance is then ready for use and other handler methods may be invoked.

The container must call the lifecycle method annotated with
javax.annotation.PreDestroy annotation on any Handler instances which it
instantiated, before releasing a handler instance from its working set.
A container must not call this method while a request is being processed
by the Handler instance. The container must not dispatch additional
requests to the Handler after the this method is called.

The requirements for processing any RuntimeException or
ProtocolException thrown from handle<action>() method of the handler are
defined in sections 9.3.2.1 and 9.3.2.2 of the JAX-WS specification.

Pooling of Handler instances is allowed, but is not required. If Handler
instances are pooled, they must be pooled by Port component. This is
because Handlers may retain non-client specific state across method
calls that are specific to the Port component. For instance, a Handler
may initialize internal data members with Port component specific
environment values. These values may not be consistent when a single
Handler type is associated with multiple Port components. Any pooled
instance of a Port component’s Handler in a Method Ready state may be
used to service handle<action>() methods in a JAX-WS based container. It
is not required that the same Handler instance service handleMessage()
or handleFault() method invocation of any given request in the JAX-WS
based container.

===== _javax.jws.HandlerChain_ annotation

The javax.jws.HandlerChain annotation from JSR-181 (imported by JAX-WS)
may be declared on Web Service endpoints (those declared with the
javax.jws.WebService or javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider annotation) or
on Web Service references (those declared with the
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotation). This annotation is used to
specify the handler chain to be applied on the declared port component
or Service reference. Details on the javax.jws.HandlerChain annotation
can be found in section 4.6 of JSR-181 specification. If this annotation
is used, the handler chain file for this must be packaged with the
application unit according to the packaging rules in Section 6.3.

The deployment descriptors on port component or Service reference
override the javax.jws.HandlerChain annotation specified in the
implementation.

The <handler-chains> element in the deployment descriptor is used for
specifying the handlers on a port component or Service reference. This
deployment descriptor allows for specifying multiple handler chains such
that all handlers in a handler chain could be specific to a Service
name, a Port name or a list of protocol bindings. Patterns on Service
names and Port names are also allowed, where in the handlers in a
handler chain could be specific to a Service name pattern or Port name
pattern. Refer to Chapter 7 for details on the deployment schema for
handlers.

JAX-WS based container provider is required to support this annotation.
They are also required to provide an implementation of HandlerResolver
that returns a handler chain with handlers specified in the deployment
descriptor or the javax.jws.HandlerChain annotation. The ordering of the
handlers in the handler chain must follow the requirements specified in
JAX-WS specification section 9.2.1.2. In addition to this, the ordering
of any given type of Handler (logical or protocol) in the deployment
descriptor must be maintained

===== Security

Handlers associated with a Port component run after authorization has
occurred and before the business logic method of the Service
Implementation bean is dispatched to. For JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service
endpoints, Handlers run after the container has performed the security
constraint checks associated with the servlet element that defines the
Port component. For EJB based service implementations, Handlers run
after method level authorization has occurred.

A Handler must not change the message in any way that would cause the
previously executed authorization check to execute differently.

A handler may perform programmatic authorization checks if the
authorization is based solely on the MessageContext and the component’s
environment values. A Handler cannot perform role based programmatic
authorization checks nor can a Handler access the Principal associated
with the request.

The Java 2 security permissions of a Handler follow the permissions
defined by the container it runs in. The application client, web, and
EJB containers may have different permissions associated with them. If
the provider allows defining permissions on a per application basis,
permissions granted to a Handler are defined by the permissions granted
to the application code it is packaged with. See section EE.6.2.3 of the
Java EE specification for more details.

===== [#anchor-69]##Transactions

Handlers run under the transaction context of the component they are
associated with.

Handlers must not demarcate transactions using the
javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface.

==== Developer Responsibilities

A developer is not required to implement a Handler. Handlers are another
means of writing business logic associated with processing a Web
services request. A developer may implement zero or more Handlers that
are associated with a Port component and/or a Service reference. If a
developer implements a Handler, they must follow the requirements
outlined in this section.

A Handler is implemented as a stateless instance. A Handler does not
maintain any message processing (client specific) related state in its
instance variables across multiple invocations of the handle method.

A Handler class using JAX-RPC must implement the
java.xml.rpc.handler.Handler interface. With JAX-WS a Handler class must
implement the javax.xml.ws.handler.Handler interface or one of its
subinterfaces.

With JAX-RPC, a Handler.handle<action>() method may access the
component’s environment entries by using JNDI lookup of the
“java:comp/env” context and accessing the env-entry-names defined in the
deployment descriptor by performing a JNDI lookup. See chapter 15 of the
Enterprise JavaBeans specification - _Enterprise JavaBeans Core
Contracts and Requirements_ for details. The container may throw a
java.lang.IllegalStateException if the environment is accessed from any
other Handler method and the environment is not available. In addition,
the Handler may use HandlerInfo.getHandlerConfig() method to access the
Handler’s init-params declared in the deployment descriptor.

With JAX-WS, the handler allows for resources to be injected, typically
by using the @Resource annotation. So a Handler.handle<action>() method
may access the component’s context and environment entries by using any
resources that were injected. It can also use JNDI lookup of the
“java:comp/env” context and accessing the env-entry-names defined in the
deployment descriptor by performing a JNDI lookup. See chapter 15 of the
Enterprise JavaBeans specification - _Enterprise JavaBeans Core
Contracts and Requirements_ for details. The container may throw a
java.lang.IllegalStateException if the environment is accessed from any
other Handler method and the environment is not available. The element
init-params in the deployment descriptors is no longer used for JAX-WS
based container. If needed, the developer should use the environment
entry elements (<env-entry>) declared in the application component's
deployment descriptor for this purpose. These can be injected into the
handler using the @Resource annotation or looked up using JNDI.

When JAX-RPC is used, the Handler.init() method must retain the
information defined by HandlerInfo.getHeaders(). With JAX-WS, Handler
implementation that implements the javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPHandler
interface must contain all the headers information needed by it.
Additionally, in this case the soap-header element declared in the
deployment descriptor is not required since that information is embedded
in the implementation of the Handler class.

With JAX-RPC, a Handler implementation must implement the getHeaders()
method to return the results of the HandlerInfo.getHeaders() method. The
headers that a Handler declares it will process (i.e. those returned by
the Handler.getHeaders() method must be defined in the WSDL definition
of the service.

With JAX-WS, only a Handler implementation that implements the
javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPHandler interface must implement the
getHeaders() method. The headers that a Handler declares it will process
(i.e. those returned by the Handler.getHeaders() method) must be defined
in the WSDL definition of the service.

A Handler implementation should test the type of the MessageContext
passed to the Handler in the handle<action>() methods. Although this
specification only requires support for SOAP messages and the container
will pass a SOAPMessageContext in this case, some providers may provide
extensions that allow other message types and MessageContext types to be
used. A Handler implementation should be ready to accept and ignore
message types which it does not understand.

A Handler implementation must use the MessageContext to pass information
to other Handler implementations in the same Handler chain and, in the
case of the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS service endpoint, to the Service
Implementation Bean. A container is not required to use the same thread
for invoking each Handler or for invoking the Service Implementation
Bean.

With JAX-RPC, a Handler may access the env-entrys of the component it is
associated with by using JNDI to lookup an appropriate subcontext of
java:comp/env. Access to the java:comp/env contexts must be supported
from the init() and handle<action>() methods. Access may not be
supported within the destroy() method.

With JAX-WS, a Handler may access the env-entrys of the component it is
associated with by using JNDI to lookup an appropriate subcontext of
java:comp/env. It may also access these if they are injected using the
@Resource annotation. Access to the java:comp/env contexts must be
supported from the method annotated with javax.annotation.PostConstruct
and handle<action>() methods. Access may not be supported within the
method annotated with javax.annotation.PreDestroy annotation.

A Handler may access transactional resources defined by a component’s
resource-refs. Resources are accessed under a transaction context
according to section link:#anchor-69[6.2.2.5].

A Handler may access the complete SOAP message and can process both SOAP
header blocks and body if the handle<action>() method is passed a
SOAPMessageContext.

A SOAPMessageContext Handler may add or remove headers from the SOAP
message. A SOAPMessageContext Handler may modify the header of a SOAP
message if it is not mapped to a parameter or if the modification does
not change value type of the parameter if it is mapped to a parameter. A
Handler may modify part values of a message if the modification does not
change the value type.

Handlers that define application specific headers should declare the
header schema in the WSDL document for the component they are associated
with, but are not required to do so.

==== Container Provider Responsibilities

In a JAX-RPC based container, a Handler chain is processed according to
the JAX-RPC specification section 12.2.2. The process order defaults to
the order the handlers are defined in the deployment descriptor and
follow the JAX-RPC specification section 12.1.4 processing order.

In a JAX-WS based container, a Handler chain is processed according to
the JAX-WS specification section 9.2.1.2. In addition to this, the
ordering of any given type of Handler (logical or protocol) in the
deployment descriptor or in the handler configuration file specified in
the javax.jws.HandlerChain annotation, must be maintained.

The container must ensure that for EJB based Web Service endpoints with
both Handlers and EJB Interceptors present, the Handlers must be invoked
before any EJB business method interceptor methods.

A JAX-RPC based container is required to provide an instance of a
java.util.Map object in the HandlerInfo instance. The
HandlerInfo.getHeaders() method must return the set of soap-headers
defined in the deployment descriptor. The Map object must provide access
to each of the Handler’s init-param name/value pairs declared in the
deployment descriptor as java.lang.String values. The container must
provide a unique HandlerInfo instance and Map config instance for each
Handler instance. A unique Handler instance must be provided for each
Port component declared in the deployment descriptor.

A JAX-WS based container must carry out any injections (if any)
requested by the handler, typically via the @Resource annotation (see
section 2.2 of JSR-250 Common Annotations for Java Platform
specification). A JAX-WS handler should use the
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceContext, which is an injectable resource, to
access message context and security information relative to the request
being served. A unique Handler instance must be provided for each Port
component declared in the deployment descriptor or annotated by
javax.jws.WebService or javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider annotations.

The container provider must ensure that for a JAX-WS based EJB endpoint
executing in the EJB container, with both Handlers and EJB Interceptors
present, the java.util.Map<String,Object> instance returned by invoking
WebServiceContext.getMessageContext() method in the JAX-WS Handler, is
the same Map instance that is obtained by invoking
InvocationContext.getContextData() in the EJB Interceptor. This common
Map instance would allow for sharing of data (if required) between the
Handlers and Interceptors.

A JAX-RPC based container must call the init() method within the context
of a Port component’s environment. The container must ensure the Port
component’s env-entrys are setup for the init method to access.

A JAX-WS based container must call the lifecycle method annotated with
javax.annotation.PostConstruct within the context of a Port component’s
environment. The container must ensure the Port component’s env-entrys
are setup for this lifecycle method to access.

The container must provide a MessageContext type unique to the request
type. For example, the container must provide a SOAPMessageContext to
the handle<action>() methods of a JAX-RPC Handler or a JAX-WS
SOAPHandler in a handler chain when processing a SOAP request. The
SOAPMessageContext must contain the complete SOAP message.

The container must share the same MessageContext instance across all
Handler instances and the target endpoint that are invoked during a
single request and response or fault processing on a specific node.

The container must setup the Port component’s execution environment
before invoking the handle<action>() methods of a handler chain.
Handlers run under the same execution environment as the Port
component’s business methods. This is required so that handlers have
access to the Port component's java:comp/env context.

=== [#anchor-39]##Packaging

A developer is required to package, either by containment or reference,
the Handler class and its dependent classes in the module with the
deployment descriptor information that references the Handler classes. A
developer is responsible for defining the handler chain information in
the deployment descriptor.

The handler chain file in the javax.jws.HandlerChain annotation is
required to be packaged in the module. It must follow the requirements
for location as specified in section 4.6.1 of JSR-181 specification (Web
Services Metadata for the Java Platform). Additionally, the handler
chain file can also be packaged and specified in the annotation such
that, it is accessible as a resource from the ClassPath. At runtime,
container providers must first try to access the handler chain file as
per the locations specified in JSR-181 specification. Failing that, they
must try to access it as a resource from the ClassPath. If more than one
resources are returned from the ClassPath, then the first one is used.

processing. In general, the interaction diagrams are meant to be

== Deployment Descriptors

This chapter describes the various deployment descriptors used for Web
Services for Java EE and the roles responsible for defining the
information within the deployment descriptors.

=== [#anchor-66]##Web Services Deployment Descriptor

This section defines the content of the webservices.xml file, location
within modules, roles and responsibilities, and the format.

==== Overview

The webservices.xml deployment descriptor file defines the set of Web
services that are to be deployed in a Web Services for Java EE enabled
container. With JAX-WS the use of webservices.xml is optional since the
annotations can be used to specify most of the information specified in
this deployment descriptor file. The deployment descriptors are only
used to override or augment the annotation member attributes. The
packaging of the webservices.xml deployment descriptor file is defined
in sections link:#anchor-55[5.4.2] and link:#anchor-56[5.4.3]. Web
services are defined by WSDL documents as described by section
link:#anchor-4[3.2]. The deployment descriptor defines the WSDL port to
Port component relationship. Port components are defined in Chapter
link:#anchor-35[5].

==== Developer responsibilities

The developer is responsible not only for the implementation of a Web
service, but also for declaring its deployment characteristics. The
deployment characteristics are defined in both the EJB annotations or
module specific deployment descriptor and Web Services annotations or
the webservices.xml deployment descriptor. Service Implementations using
a stateless or singleton session bean may use EJB annotations with no
deployment descriptor file. If the EJB annotations are not specified
then the stateless or singleton session bean must be defined in the
ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor file using the session element.
Service Implementations using a JAX-RPC Service Endpoint must be defined
in the web.xml deployment descriptor file using the servlet-class
element. Servlet based web service endpoints using JAX-WS are not
required to provide the web.xml deployment descriptor file (see section
5.3.2.1). See the Enterprise JavaBeans and Servlet specifications for
additional details on developer requirements for defining deployment
descriptors. The developer is also required to provide structural
information that defines the Port components within the webservices.xml
deployment descriptor file. The developer is responsible for providing
the set of WSDL documents that describe the Web services to be deployed,
the Java classes that represent the Web services, and the mapping that
correlates the two.

The developer is responsible for providing the following information in
the webservices.xml deployment descriptor:

* **Port’s name. **A logical name for the port must be specified by the
developer using the port-component-name element. This name bears no
relationship to the WSDL port name. This name must be unique amongst all
port component names in a module.
* **Port’s bean class. **The developer declares the implementation of
the Web service using the service-impl-bean element of the deployment
descriptor. The bean declared in this element must refer to a class that
implements the methods of the Port’s Service Endpoint Interface. This
element allows a choice of implementations. For a JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
Service Endpoint, the servlet-link element associates the port-component
with a JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Endpoint class defined in the web.xml
by the servlet-class element. For a stateless or singleton session bean
implementation, the ejb-link element associates the port-component with
a session element in the ejb-jar.xml. The ejb-link element may not refer
to a session element defined in another module. A servlet must only be
linked to by a single port-component. A session EJB must only be linked
to by a single port-component.
* **Port’s Service Endpoint Interface. **The developer must specify the
fully qualified class name of the Service Endpoint Interface in the
service-endpoint-interface element. The Service Endpoint Interface
requirements may be found in section link:#anchor-42[5.3.1]. If the
Service Implementation is a stateless session EJB, the developer must
also specify the Service Endpoint Interface in the EJB deployment
descriptor using the service-endpoint element. See the Enterprise
JavaBeans 3.0 specification for more details.
* *Port’s WSDL definition.* The wsdl-file element specifies a location
of the WSDL description of a set of Web services. The location is
relative to the root of the module and must be specified by the
developer. The WSDL file may reference (e.g. import) other files
contained within the module using relative references. It may also
reference other files external to the module using an explicit URL.
Relative imports are declared relative to the file defining the import.
Imported files may import other files as well using relative locations
or explicit URLs. It is recommended that the WSDL file and relative
referenced files be packaged in the wsdl directory as described in
section link:#anchor-52[5.4.1]. Relative references must not start with
a “/”.
* **Service QName. **In addition to specifying the WSDL document, the
developer may also specify the WSDL Service QName in the wsdl-service
element for each Port defined in the deployment descriptor when JAX-WS
based runtime is used. This element is required if the port-component
being defined is a Provider Interface defined by JAX-WS.
* *Port’s QName.* In addition to specifying the WSDL document, the
developer must also specify the WSDL port QName in the wsdl-port element
for each Port defined in the deployment descriptor.
* **MTOM/XOP support. **The developer may specify if MTOM/XOP support
for the port-component is enabled or disabled by using enable-mtom
element when JAX-WS based runtime is used.
* **Addressing support. **The developer may specify an addressing
support for the port-component by using addressing element when JAX-WS
based runtime is used.
* **RespectBindingg support. **The developer may specify a respect
binding support for the port-component by using respect-binding element
when JAX-WS based runtime is used.
* **Protocol Binding. **The developer may override the protocol binding
specified by BindingType annotation by specifying the URI or a
pre-defined token (like ##SOAP11_HTTP, ##SOAP12_HTTP, ##XML_HTTP etc.)
in the protocol-binding element when JAX-WS based runtime is used. The
default protocol binding is ##SOAP11_HTTP. If this element is not
specified then the default value is assumed. The pre-defined tokens
essentially act as alias for the actual URI for the protocol binding.
The URIs for these pre-defined tokens are listed below:
* ##SOAP11_HTTP - "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/http"
* ##SOAP12_HTTP - "http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/bindings/HTTP/"
* ##SOAP11_HTTP_MTOM -
"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/http?mtom=true"
* ##SOAP12_HTTP_MTOM –
"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/bindings/HTTP/?mtom=true"
* ##XML_HTTP - "http://www.w3.org/2004/08/wsdl/http"
* *JAX-RPC Mapping.* The developer must specify the correlation of the
WSDL definition to the interfaces using the jaxrpc-mapping-file element.
This element is only required when JAX-RPC based runtime is used. Its
not required with JAX-WS and ignored if specified. The requirements for
specifying information in the jaxrpc-mapping-file are covered in section
link:#anchor-70[7.3]. The same mapping file must be used for all
interfaces associated with a wsdl-file.
* *Handlers.* A developer may optionally specify handlers associated
with the port-component using either the handler element when JAX-RPC
based runtime is used or the handler-chains element when JAX-WS based
runtime is used. With JAX-WS, the soap-header element declared in the
deployment descriptor is not required since that information is embedded
in the implementation of the Handler class. With JAX-WS, init-params
element in the deployment descriptors is no longer used. If needed, the
developer should use the environment entry elements (<env-entry>)
declared in the application component's deployment descriptor for this
purpose. These can be injected into the handler using the @Resource
annotation or looked up using JNDI.
* **Servlet Mapping. **A developer may optionally specify a
servlet-mapping, in the web.xml deployment descriptor, for a JAX-RPC or
JAX-WS Service Endpoint. No more than one servlet-mapping may be
specified for a servlet that is linked to by a port-component. The
url-pattern of the servlet-mapping must be an exact match pattern (i.e.
it must not contain an asterisk (“*”)).

Note that if the WSDL specifies an address statement within the port,
its URI address is ignored. This address is generated and replaced
during the deployment process in the deployed WSDL.

See also the developer requirements defined in section
link:#anchor-71[7.2.2].

==== Assembler responsibilities

The assembler’s responsibilities for Web Services for Java EE are an
extension of the assembler responsibilities as defined by the Enterprise
JavaBeans, Servlet, and Java EE specifications. The assembler creates a
deployable artifact by composing multiple modules, resolving
cross-module dependencies, providing annotation overrides and producing
an EAR file.

The assembler may modify any of the following information that has been
specified by the developer in the webservices.xml deployment descriptor
file:

* *Description fields.* The assembler may change existing or create new
description elements.
* *Handlers.* The assembler may change values of existing param-value
elements, may add new init-param elements, may change or add soap-header
elements with JAX-RPC, may change or add soap-role elements, or may add
new handler elements or new handler-chain elements. With JAX-WS, Handler
implementation must contain all the soap-header information needed by
it.

See also the assembler responsibilities defined in
sectionlink:#anchor-72[7.2.3].

==== Deployer responsibilities

The deployer responsibilities are defined by the Java EE, Enterprise
JavaBeans, and Servlet specifications.

In addition, the deployer must resolve the following information:

* where published WSDL definitions are placed. The deployer must publish
every webservice-description wsdl-file with the correct port address
attribute value to access the service.
* the value of the port address attribute for deployed services.

==== Web Services Deployment Descriptor XML Schema

The XML Schema for the Web service deployment descriptor is described at
http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/javaee_web_services_1_4.xsd

=== [#anchor-67]##Service Reference Deployment Descriptor Information

This section defines the function of the Service Reference XML schema
file, its use within modules, the platform roles and responsibilities
for defining instance data, and the format.

==== Overview

The Service Reference XML schema defines the schema for service
reference entries. These entries declare references to Web services used
by a Java EE component in the web, EJB, or application client container.
With JAX-WS, these entries are not required if
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotation is used. If the Web services
client is a Java EE component, then it uses a logical name for the Web
service called a service reference to look up the service. Any component
that uses a Web service reference must declare a dependency on the Web
service reference in a module’s deployment descriptor file.

==== [#anchor-71]##Developer responsibilities

The developer is responsible for defining a service-ref for each Web
service a component within the module wants to reference. This includes
the following information:

* **Service Reference Name. **This defines a logical name for the
reference that is used in the client source code. It is recommended, but
not required that the name begin with service/.
* *Service type:* The service-interface element defines the fully
qualified name of the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Interface/Class class
returned by the JNDI lookup.
* *Service Reference type:* The service-ref-type element declares the
type of the service-ref element that is injected or returned when a JNDI
lookup is done. This must be either a fully qualified name of Service
class or the fully qualified name of Service endpoint interface class.
This is an optional element and used only with JAX-WS.
* *Ports.* The developer declares requirements for container managed
port resolution using the port-component-ref element. The
port-component-ref elements are resolved to a WSDL port by the
container. See Chapter link:#anchor-18[4] for a discussion of container
managed port access.
* *MTOM/XOP support.* The developer may specify if MTOM/XOP support for
the port-component-ref is enabled or disabled by using enable-mtom
element when JAX-WS based runtime is used.
* *Addressing support.* The developer may specify an addressing support
for the port-component-ref by using _addressing_ element when JAX-WS
based runtime is used.
* *RespectBinding support.* The developer may specify a respect binding
support for the _port-component-ref_ by using _respect-binding_ element
when JAX-WS based runtime is used.

The developer may specify the following information:

* [#anchor-73]##**WSDL definition.** The wsdl-file element specifies a
location of the WSDL description of the service. The location is
relative to the root of the module. The WSDL description may be a
partial WSDL, but must at least include the portType and binding
elements. The WSDL description provided by the developer is considered a
template that must be preserved by the assembly/deployment process. In
other words, the WSDL description contains a declaration of the
application’s dependency on portTypes, bindings, and QNames. The WSDL
document must be fully specified, including the service and port
elements, if the application is dependent on port QNames (e.g. uses the
Service.getPort(QName,Class) method). The developer must specify the
wsdl-file if any of the Service methods declared in section
link:#anchor-31[4.2.4.4] or link:#anchor-32[4.2.4.5] are used. The WSDL
file may reference (e.g. import) other files contained within the module
using relative references. It may also reference other files external to
the module using an explicit URL. Relative imports are declared relative
to the file defining the import. Imported files may import other files
as well using relative locations or explicit URLs. Relative references
must not start with a “/”.
* *Service Port.* If the specified wsdl-file has more than one service
element, the developer must specify the service-qname.
* **JAX-RPC Mapping. **The developer specifies the correlation of the
WSDL definition to the interfaces using the jaxrpc-mapping-file element.
This element is only required when JAX-RPC based runtime is used. Its
not required with JAX-WS. The location is relative to the root of the
module. The same mapping file must be used for all interfaces associated
with a wsdl-file. The developer must specify the jaxrpc-mapping-file if
the wsdl-file is specified.
* *Handlers.* A developer may optionally specify handlers associated
with the service-ref using the handler element when JAX-RPC based
runtime is used. The developer may optionally use the handler-chains
element when specifying handler chains associated with the service-ref
under JAX-WS based runtime.

==== [#anchor-72]##Assembler responsibilities

In addition to the responsibilities defined within the Java EE
specification, the assembler may define the following information:

* *Binding of service references*. The assembler may link a Web service
reference to a component within the Java EE application unit using the
port-component-link element. It is the assembler’s responsibility to
ensure there are no detailed differences in the SEI and target bindings
that would cause stub generation or runtime problems.

The assembler may modify any of the following information that has been
specified by the developer in the service-ref element of the module’s
deployment descriptor file:

* *Description fields.* The assembler may change existing or create new
description elements.
* *Handlers.* The assembler may change values of existing param-value
elements, may add new init-param elements, may change or add soap-header
elements with JAX-RPC, may change or add soap-role elements, or may add
new handler elements or new handler-chain elements. With JAX-WS, Handler
implementation must contain all the soap-header information needed by
it.
* *WSDL definition.* The assembler may replace the WSDL definition with
a new WSDL that resolves missing service and port elements or missing
port address attributes. The assembler may update the port address
attribute__.__

==== Deployer responsibilities

In addition to the normal duties a Java EE deployer platform role has,
the deployer must also provide deploy time binding information to
resolve the WSDL document to be used for each service-ref. If a partial
WSDL document was specified and service and port elements are needed by
a vendor to resolve the binding, they may be generated. The deployer is
also responsible for providing deploy time binding information to
resolve port access declared by the port-component-ref element.

==== Web Services Client Service Reference XML Schema

[#anchor-74]##This section defines the XML Schema for the service-ref at
http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/javaee_web_services_client_1_4.xsd.
This schema is imported into the common Java EE schema and is used by
the application client, web, and EJB module deployment descriptor
schemas to declare service-refs. See the Java EE 7 and corresponding
versions of Servlet and EJB specifications for more details on
specifying a service-ref in the deployment descriptors.

=== [#anchor-40]##[#anchor-70]##JAX-RPC Mapping Deployment Descriptor

This section defines the content of the JAX-RPC mapping file, location
within modules, roles and responsibilities, and the format. It applies
only to JAX-RPC based runtime. This mapping file is not required in
JAX-WS since it uses JAXB specification for all its data binding needs.

==== Overview

The JAX-RPC mapping deployment descriptor has no standard file name,
though it is recommended that the file use a .xml suffix. There is a 1-1
correspondence between WSDL files and mapping files within a module. The
JAX-RPC mapping deployment descriptor contains information that
correlates the mapping between the Java interfaces and WSDL definition.
A deployment tool uses this information along with the WSDL file to
generate stubs and TIEs for the deployed services and service-refs.

==== Developer responsibilities

A developer creates the mapping file at the same time that the WSDL
and/or Java interfaces are created. A developer may specify only the
package-mapping if the following conditions are met:

* The WSDL file must contain exactly one service element.
* The service element must define exactly one port.
* The set of service name, binding name, portType name, and all root
WSDL type (e.g. complexType, simpleType, etc.) names must be unique.
* The port’s binding must be a soap 1.1 binding with style="rpc"; all
its operations must specify use="encoded", encodingStyle="_<the SOAP 1.1
encoding>_" for their input, output, and fault messages and either omit
the parts attribute or include it such that all the parts of both the
input and output message are mapped to the soap body. Also, no soap
headers or header faults can be specified in the binding.
* Each operation must:
* Have a unique name (in the context of the portType it belongs to) that
follows the Java conventions for method names.
* Have exactly one input message.
* Have at most one output message.
* Have zero or more fault messages.
* Either have no parameterOrder attribute or the value of that attribute
must be a complete listing of all parts in the input message in the
order they appear therein.
* Faults must map to an exception such that it:
* Directly or indirectly inherits from java.lang.Exception, but must not
inherit from RuntimeException nor RemoteException.
* Has at most a single property called “message” of type
java.lang.String with corresponding single String argument constructor.
* Must be SOAP encoded.
* Each input message may have 0 or more parts
* Each output message must have either 0 or 1 parts. If present, the
part must have a name different from that of any parts in the input
message.
* Each part must be of this form:

* <part name="..." type="_T_"/>

* Each type __T __must be one of the following valid types:
* A simple type defined in table 4-1, section 4.2.1 of the JAX-RPC
specification.
* A complex type using either the sequence compositor:

<xsd:complexType name="_T_">

____
<xsd:sequence>
____

<xsd:element name="..." type="_Tprime_"/>

____
</xsd:sequence>
____

</xsd:complexType>

* Or the all compositor:

<xsd:complexType name="_T_">

____
<xsd:all>
____

<xsd:element name="..." type="_Tprime_"/>

____
</xsd:all>
____

</xsd:complexType>

* In either case, the element declarations can appear one or more times
and each type _Tprime_ must be valid. All element names are mapped as
JavaBeans properties and element names follow the standard JavaBeans
property name convention of lower case for the first character and the
complexType name follows the Java standard class name conventions of
upper case first letter.

* A SOAP array of the form:

<xsd:complexType name="...">

____
<xsd:restriction base="soapenc:Array"/>
____

<xsd:attribute ref="soapenc:arrayType"

____
wsdl:arrayType="_Tprime_[]"/>
____

____
</xsd:restriction>
____

</xsd:complexType>

* where Tprime is a valid type and is not a SOAP array type.

If the conditions are not met, a full mapping must be specified. There
must be a java-xml-type-mapping for every global type definition that is
reachable from the port types (and its attributes like operations,
faults, messages etc.) in the WSDL file.. An exception-mapping must be
created for each WSDL fault. There must be a service-interface-mapping
for every service element in the WSDL file that has a Generated Service
Interface used by the developer. There must be a
service-endpoint-interface-mapping for every combination of portType and
binding in the WSDL file. There must be a package-mapping for every
namespace defined in the WSDL file.

Web Services for Java EE providers may support partial mapping
specifications (e.g. not providing a method-param-parts-mapping for
every method) regardless of the WSDL content by using standard JAX-RPC
WSDL to Java mapping rules to resolve the mappings. If mappings are
specified, they take precedence over the mapping rules. Applications
that use partial mappings are therefore non-portable.

For INOUT parameters, only the mapping for the input message is
required.

The developer must define the jaxrpc-mapping-file element of the
webservices.xml or module deployment descriptor (if a service-ref is
used) to be the location of the mapping file.

The developer must package the mapping file in the module with the WSDL
file.

===== Mapping xsd:any

Mapping for xsd:any is described by the JAX-RPC specification. JAX-RPC
defines this as a mapping to/from javax.xml.soap.SoapElement or an array
of type SoapElement.

===== Mapping anonymous types

Anonymous types require some special handling in order to provide a
mapping. Anonymous types have no QName, but dealing with mappings,
serializers, and deserializers becomes much easier if they are assigned
QNames. Anonymous types are treated as root WSDL types with special
QNames and are mapped using the java-xml-type-mapping. In order to
achieve some portability in determining what anonymous type a
java-xml-type-mapping refers to, the following rules must be used.

[arabic]
. For type T, the qname-scope is either complexType or simpleType
depending on the type of T and the localname of T is determined as
follows:

[loweralpha]
. If T has a name attribute, then its name is the value of the name
attribute and is entered as a root-type-qname.
. If T has no name attribute, then its name is “>E” where E is the name
of its enclosing element. The name is entered as an
_anonymous-type-qname_.

[arabic]

of the name attribute. The name is entered as a root-type-qname.
. If E is not at the root level, then the name “T>N” where T is the name
of the enclosing type and N is the value of the name attribute. The name
is entered as an anonymous-type-qname.

. If E has a name attribute, then the name of A is
"E[<minOccursValue>,<maxOccursValue>]" where E is the value of E’s name

In the interest of portability, vendors must accept both a null string
and a value of ‘1’ for <minOccursValue>. For example, E[,10] and E[1,10]
are equivalent names.
____

Note that only root level types and elements have a namespace, so all
anonymous types acquire their namespaces from the enclosing root level
element or type. An anonymous type QName is not a valid QName, therefore
the namespace should be fully specified rather than relying on XML
Schema namespace prefix resolution. This is the only supported form for
portability. In this case, the namespace is parsed to include all the
characters up to the right-most ‘:’ (colon). The right-most colon serves
as a delimiter between the namespace and localpart.

Hidden anonymous array types, as defined in rule
link:#anchor-75[7.3.2.2], are declared in a param-type element as the
name of the Java type of type T appended with “[]” if the mapping is to
a Java array. This is the only supported and portable mapping for hidden
anonymous array types at this time.

The following example will help illustrate anonymous types and their
mappings. Example name rule uses are underlined:

<schema … targetNamespace=”X”>

<__complexType__^_1_^ name=”root”>

<sequence>

<element name="data" type="string" />

</sequence>

</complexType>

<__element__^_2_^ name="root" __minOccurs="0"

</element>

<element ref="someOtherElement" __maxOccurs="20"__^_8_^/>

</sequence>

</complexType>

</element>

<__ element__^_9_^ name=”someOtherElement” type=”xsd:int”>

There are 9 named types. Their names are defined as:

[cols=",,",]
|===
|Use case |Rule based name |Based on rule
|1 |X:root |Rule 1.a
|2 |X:root |Rule 2.a

===== Mapping multiple output params

The mapping for OUT and IN/OUT parameters must be the Java class-type
representation of the WSDL type. This is true even when multiple OUT or
IN/OUT parts exist within a WSDL message. In this case, the Holder type
is inferred based on the specified class-type.

==== Assembler responsibilities

The assembler must not change the JAX-RPC Mapping file.

==== Deployer responsibilities

The deployer uses deployment tools to deploy the services and
service-refs contained inside a module. The deployment tool must use the
JAX-RPC mapping file to generate stubs and TIEs for the services and
service-refs.

==== JAX-RPC Mapping Schema

This XML Schema for the JAX-RPC mapping files is described at
http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/j2ee_jaxrpc_mapping_1_1.xsd

== Deployment 

This chapter defines the deployment process requirements and
responsibilities. Deployment tasks are handled by the Java EE deployer
platform role using tools typically provided by the Web Services for
Java EE product provider. This includes the generation of container
specific classes for the Web services and Web service references,
configuration of the server’s SOAP request listeners for each port,
publication and location of Web services, as well as the normal
responsibilities defined by the Java EE specification.

=== Overview

[#anchor-76]##This section describes an illustrative process of
deployment for Web Services for Java EE. The process itself is not
required, but there are certain requirements that deployment must meet
which are detailed in later sections of this chapter. This process
assumes that there are two general phases for deployment. The first
phase maps Web services into standard Java EE artifacts and the second
phase is standard Java EE deployment.

Deployment starts with a service enabled application or module. The
deployer uses a deployment tool to start the deployment process. In
general, the deployment tool validates the content as a correctly
assembled deployment artifact, collects binding information from the
deployer, deploys the components and Web services defined within the
modules, publishes the WSDL documents representing the deployed Web
services, deploys any clients using Web services, configures the server
and starts the application.

The deployment tool starts the deployment process by examining the
deployable artifact and determining which modules are Web service
enabled by looking for Web service metadata annotations or
webservices.xml deployment descriptor file contained within the module.
Deployment of services occurs before resolution of service references.
This is done to allow deployment to update the WSDL port addresses
before the service references to them are processed.

Validation of the artifact packaging is performed to ensure that:

* Every port in every WSDL defined in the Web services deployment
descriptor has a corresponding port-component element.
* JAX-RPC or JAX-WS service components are only packaged within a WAR
file.
* Stateless or Singleton session bean Web services are only packaged
within an EJB-JAR or WAR file.
* The WSDL bindings used by the WSDL ports are supported by the Web
Services for Java EE runtime. Bindings that are not supported may be
declared within the WSDL if no port uses them.

Deployment of each port-component is dependent upon the service
implementation and container used. Deployment of a JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
Service Endpoint requires different handling than deployment of a
session bean service.

If the implementation is a JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Endpoint, a servlet
is generated to handle parsing the incoming SOAP request and dispatch it
to an instance of the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS service component. The generated
servlet class is dependent on threading model of the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
Service Endpoint. The web.xml deployment descriptor is updated to
replace the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Endpoint class with the generated
servlet class. If the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Endpoint was specified
without a corresponding servlet-mapping, the deployment tool generates
one. The WSDL port address for the Port component is the combination of
the web app context-root and url-pattern of the servlet-mapping. If the
implementation is a stateless or singleton session bean, the deployment
tool has a variety of options available to it. In general, the
deployment tool generates a servlet to handle parsing the incoming SOAP
request, the servlet obtains a reference to an instance of an
appropriate EJBObject and dispatches the request to the stateless or
singleton session EJB. How the request is dispatched to the Service
Implementation Bean is dependent on the deployment tool and deploy time
binding information supplied by the deployer.

The deployment tool must deploy and publish all the ports of all WSDL
documents referenced by Web service metadata annotations or described in
the Web services deployment descriptor. The deployment tool updates or
generates the WSDL port address for each deployed port-component. The
updated WSDL documents are then published to a location determined by
the deployer. It could be as simple as publishing to a file in the
modules containing the deployed services, a URL location representing
the deployed services of the server, a UDDI or ebXML registry, or a
combination of these. This is required for the next step, which is
resolving references to Web services.

For each service reference annotated with javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef or
described in the Web services client deployment descriptors, the
deployment tool ensures that the client code can access the Web service.
The deployment tool examines the information provided in the
WebServiceRef annotation or the client deployment descriptor (the
Service interface class, the Service Endpoint Interface class, and WSDL
ports the client wants to access) as well as the JAX-RPC mapping
information (not required for JAX-WS). In general the procedure includes
providing an implementation of the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service
interface/class class declared in the deployment descriptor service
reference, generating stubs for all the service-endpoint-interface
declarations (if generated Stubs are supported and the deployer decides
to use them), and binding the Service class implementation into a JNDI
namespace. The specifics depend on whether or not the service is
declared as a client managed or container managed access.

When client managed port access is used, the deployment tool must
provide generated stubs or dynamic proxy access to every port that uses
either the javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotation or is declared within
the Web services client deployment descriptor. The choice of generated
stub or dynamic proxy is deploy time binding information. The container
must provide an implementation for a Generated Service Interface if
declared within the deployment descriptor.

When container managed port access to a service is used, the container
must provide generated stubs or dynamic proxy access to every port
declared within the deployment descriptor. The choice of generated stub
or dynamic proxy is deploy time binding information. The deployment
descriptor may contain a port-component-link to associate the reference
not only with the Service Endpoint Implementation, but with the WSDL
that defines it.

Once the Web services enabled deployable artifact has been converted
into a Java EE deployable artifact, the deployment process continues
using normal deployment processes.

It is recommended that containers provide logging functionality similar
to that of the WS-I "Monitor" tool. Such contains would log all incoming
and outgoing messages in the format defined by the WS-I Testing Tools
group and would allow capturing SOAP messages exchanged over the HTTPS
protocol in a way that allows analysis by the WS-I tools.

==== JAX-WS HTTP SPI

JAX-WS 2.2 introduces HTTP SPI that allows a deployment to use any
available JAX-WS web services runtime for HTTP transport. This allows
109 implementations to use the JAX-WS 2.2 runtime in a Java SE platform
when it is available. For more details on the HTTP SPI, see the section
6.6 of JAX-WS specification.

=== Container Provider requirements

This section details the requirements of the container provider. This
includes both the container runtime and the deployment tooling.

==== Deployment artifacts

A deployment tool must be capable of deploying an EAR file (containing
WARs and/or EJB-JARs), WAR file, or EJB-JAR containing Web services
and/or Web services references.

A deployment tool must be able to deploy a WS-I Basic Profile 1.0
compliant application. Validating an application for WS-I Basic Profile
1.0 conformance is considered a value add.

==== Generate Web Service Implementation classes

Generation of any run-time classes the container requires to support a
JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Endpoint or Stateless or Singleton Session
Bean Service Implementation is provider specific. The behavior of the
run-time classes must match the information provided by annotations or
deployment descriptor settings of the component. A JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
Service Endpoint must match the behavior defined by the <servlet>
element in the web.xml deployment descriptor. A Stateless Session Bean
Service Implementation must match the behavior defined by the
javax.ejb.Stateless annotation or <session> element and the
<assembly-descriptor> in the ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor. A
Singleton Bean Service Implementation must match the behavior defined by
the _javax.ejb.Singleton_ annotation or _<session>_ element and the
_<assembly-descriptor>_ in the _ejb-jar.xml_ deployment descriptor.

==== [#anchor-77]##Generate deployed WSDL

The container must update and/or generate a deployed WSDL document for
each wsdlLocation element in the Web service annotations (described in
section 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2) or declared wsdl-file element in the Web
services deployment descriptor (webservices.xml). If multiple wsdl-file
elements refer to the same location, a separate WSDL document must be
generated for each. The container must not update a WSDL file located in
the document root of a WAR file.

The WSDL document described by the wsdl-file element must contain
service and port elements and every port-component in the deployment
descriptor must have a corresponding WSDL port and vice versa. The
deployment tool must update the WSDL port address element to produce a
deployed WSDL document. The generated port address information is
deployment time binding information. In the case of a port-component
within a web module, the address is partially constrained by the
context-root of the web application and partially constructed from the
servlet-mapping (if specified).

==== [#anchor-53]##Publishing the service-ref WSDL

The deployment tool and/or container must make the WSDL document that a
service-ref (or a javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotated Web service
reference) is bound to available via a URL returned by the Service
Interface getWSDLDocumentLocation() method. This may or may not be the
same WSDL document packaged in the module. The process of publishing the
bound service-ref (or a javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotated Web service
reference) WSDL is analogous to publishing deployed WSDL, but only the
service-ref (or a javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotated Web service
reference) that is bound to it is required to have access to it. A Web
Services for Java EE provider is required to provide a URL that
maintains the referential integrity of the WSDL document the service-ref
(or a javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotated Web service reference) is
bound to if the wsdl-file (wsdlLocation in WebServiceRef) element refers
to a document located in the wsdl directory or one of its
subdirectories.

==== [#anchor-54]##Publishing the deployed WSDL

The deployment tool must publish every deployed WSDL document. The
deployed WSDL document may be published to a file, URL, or registry.
File and URL publication must be supported by the provider. File
publication includes within the generated artifacts of the application.
Publication to a registry, such as UDDI or ebXML, is encouraged but is
not required.

If publication to a location other than file or URL is supported, then
location of a WSDL document containing a service from that location must
also be supported. As an example, a Web services deployment descriptor
declares a wsdl-file StockQuoteDescription.wsdl and a port-component
which declares a port QName within the WSDL document. When deployed, the
port address in StockQuoteDescription.wsdl is updated to the deployed
location. This is published to a UDDI registry location. In the same
application, a service-ref uses a port-component-link to refer to the
deployed port-component. The provider must support locating the deployed
WSDL for that port component from the registry it was published to. This
support must be available to a deployed client that is not bundled with
the application containing the service.

Publishing to at least one location is required. Publishing to multiple
locations is allowed, but not required. The choice of where (both
location and how many places) to publish is deployment time binding
information.

A Web Services for Java EE provider is required to support publishing a
deployed WSDL document if the wsdlLocation element in the Web service
annotations (described in section 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2) or Web services
deployment descriptor (webservices.xml) wsdl-file element refers to a
WSDL file contained in the wsdl directory or subdirectory, as described
in section link:#anchor-52[5.4.1]. A vendor may support publication of
WSDL files packaged in other locations, but these are considered
non-portable. A provider may publish the static content (e.g. no JSPs or
Servlets) of the entire wsdl directory and all its subdirectories if the
deploy tool cannot compute the minimal set of documents to publish in
order to maintain referential integrity. The recommended practice is to
place WSDL files referenced by a wsdlLocation element in the Web service
annotations or wsdl-file element and their relative imported documents
under the wsdl directory.

Web Services for Java EE providers are free to organize the published
WSDL documents however they see fit so long as referential integrity is
maintained. For example, the wsdl directory tree may be collapsed to a
flat published directory structure (updating import statements
appropriately). Clients should not depend on the wsdl directory
structure being maintained during publication. Access to relatively
imported documents should only be attempted by traversing the published
WSDL document at the location chosen by the deployer.

Requirements for publishing WSDL documents to a UDDI V2 directory are
described by the WS-I Basic Profile 1.0 specification.

==== Service and Generated Service Interface/Class implementation

The container must provide an implementation of the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
Service Interface/Class. There is no requirement for a Service
Implementation to be created during deployment. The container may
substitute a Generated Service Interface/Class Implementation for a
generic Service Interface/Class Implementation.

The container must provide an implementation of the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
Generated Service Interface/Class if the Web services client deployment
descriptor defines one. A Generated Service Interface/Class
Implementation will typically be provided during deployment.

The Service Interface/Class Implementation must provide a static stub
and/or dynamic proxy for all ports declared by the service element in
the WSDL description. A container provider must support at least one of
static stubs or dynamic proxies, but may provide support for both.

The container must make the required Service Interface Implementation
available at the JNDI namespace location
java:comp/env/__service-ref-name __where _service-ref-name_ is the name
declared within the Web services client deployment descriptor using the
service-ref-name element.

==== Static stub generation

A deployment tool may support generation of static stubs. A container
provider must support static stub generation if dynamic proxies are not
supported. Static stubs are provider specific and, in general, a
developer should avoid packaging them with the application.

Static stubs (and dynamic proxies) must conform to the JAX-RPC
specification sections 8.2.1 and 8.2.2. JAX-WS specification makes no
distinction between stubs and dynamic proxies, but talks only about
proxies and they must conform to JAX-WS specification section 4.2.3.

The container is required to support credential propagation as defined
in section link:#anchor-34[4.2.6] without client code intervention.
Whether or not the stub/proxy directly supports this or another part of
the container does is out of the scope of this specification.

==== Type mappings

Support for type mappings is provider specific. There is no means for
creating portable type mappings and therefore no means for declaring
them or deploying them required by this specification.

==== Mapping requirements

For JAX-RPC, the deployment tool must use the mapping meta-data
requirements defined by the jaxrpc-mapping-file. All mappings must be
applied before default rules are applied.

==== Deployment failure conditions

Deployment may fail if:

* The webservices.xml deployment descriptor is invalid or Web service
metadata annotations specified are incorrect
* The WSDL file, JAX-RPC mapping file (not required with JAX-WS) and
deployment descriptor or Web service metadata annotations conflict
* The implementation methods and operations conflict
* Any Port component cannot be deployed

* Every port in every WSDL defined in the Web services deployment
descriptor doesn’t have a corresponding port-component element.
* JAX-RPC or JAX-WS service components are not packaged within a WAR
file.
* Stateless or Singleton session bean Web services are not packaged
within an EJB-JAR or WAR file.
* The WSDL bindings used by the WSDL ports are not supported by the Web
Services for Java EE runtime. However, bindings that are not supported
may be declared within the WSDL if no port uses them.
* The header QNames returned by a Handler.getHeaders() method are not
defined in the WSDL for the port-component the Handler is executing on
behalf of.

=== Deployer responsibilities

The deployer role is responsible for specifying the deployment time
binding information. This may include deployed WSDL port addresses and
credential information for requests that do not use a CallbackHandler.

If a service-ref contains a port-component-ref that contains a
port-component-link, the deployer should bind the container managed Port
for the SEI to the deployed port address of the port-component referred
to by the port-component-link. For example, given a webservices.xml file
containing:

<webservices>

<webservice-description>

<webservice-description-name>JoesServices</webservice-description-name>

<wsdl-file>META-INF/joe.wsdl</wsdl-file>

<jaxrpc-mapping-file>META-INF/joes_mappings.xml</jaxrpc-mapping-file>

<port-component>

<port-component-name>JoePort</port-component-name>

…

<service-impl-bean>

<ejb-link>JoeEJB</ejb-link>

</service-impl-bean>

</port-component>

</webservice-description>

</webservices>

and a module’s deployment descriptor containing:

<service-ref>

<service-ref-name>service/Joe</service-ref-name>

<service-interface>javax.xml.rpc.Service</service-interface>

<wsdl-file>WEB-INF/joe.wsdl</wsdl-file>

…

<port-component-ref>

<service-endpoint-interface>sample.Joe</service-endpoint-interface>

<port-component-link>JoePort</port-component-link>

</port-component-ref>

</service-ref>

During deployment, the deployer must provide a binding for the port
address of the JoePort port-component. This port address must be defined
in the published WSDL for JoesServices. The deployer must also provide a
binding for container managed port access to the sample.Joe Service
Endpoint Interface. This should be the same binding used for the port
address of the JoePort port-component.

When providing a binding for a port-component-ref, the deployer must
ensure that the port-component-ref is compatible with the Port being
bound to.

== Security

This section defines the security requirements for Web Services for Java
EE. A conceptual overview of security and how it applies to Web services
is covered in the link:#anchor-78[Concepts] section. The
link:#anchor-79[Goals] section defines what this specification attempts
to address and the link:#anchor-80[Specification] section covers the
requirements.

=== [#anchor-78]##Concepts

The Web services security challenge is to understand and assess the risk
involved in securing a web based service today and at the same time to
track emerging standards and understand how they will be deployed to
offset the risk in the future. Any security model must illustrate how
data can flow through an application and network topology to meet the
requirements defined by the business without exposing the data to undue
risk. A Web services security model should support protocol independent
declarative security policies that Web Service for Java EE providers can
enforce, and descriptive security policies attached to the service
definitions that clients can use in order to securely access the
service.

The five security requirements that need to be addressed to assure the
safety of information exchange are:

* *Authentication* – the verification of the claimant’s entitlements to
use the claimed identity and/or privilege set.
* *Authorization* – the granting of authority to an identity to perform
certain actions on resources
* *Integrity* – the assurance that the message was not modified
accidentally or deliberately in transit.
* *Confidentiality* – the guarantee that the contents of the message are
not disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
* *Non-repudiation* – the guarantee that the sender of the message
cannot deny that the sender has sent it. This request also implies
message origin authentication.

The risks associated with these requirements can be avoided with a
combination of various existing and emerging technologies and standards
in Java EE environments. There are fundamental business reasons
underlying the existence of various security mechanisms to mitigate the
various security risks outlined above. The authentication of the entity
is necessary. This helps provide access based on the identity of the
caller of the Web service. The business reason for data integrity is so
that each party in a transaction can have confidence in the business
transaction. It’s also a business-legal issue to have an audit trail and
some evidence of non-repudiation to address liability issues. And more
and more businesses are becoming aware of the internal threats to their
applications by employees or others _inside_ the firewall. Some business
transactions require that confidentiality be provided on a service
invocation or its data (like credit card numbers). There is also the
need for businesses on the Internet to protect themselves from denial of
service attacks being mounted. This is the environment in which we need
to assert a security service model.

==== Authentication

Since the Web services architecture builds on existing component
technologies, intra-enterprise authentication is no different than
today’s approaches. In order for two or more parties to communicate
securely they may need to exchange security credentials. Web service’s
security is used to exchange many different types of credentials. A
credential represents the authenticity of the identity it is associated
with e.g., Kerberos ticket. A credential can be validated to verify the
authenticity and the identity can then be inferred from the credential.

When two parties communicate, it is also important for the sender to
understand the security requirements of the target service. This helps
the sender to provide necessary credentials along with the request.
Alternatively, the target may challenge the sender for necessary
credential (similar to how HTTP servers challenge the HTTP clients).

In the future, it is expected that message level security mechanisms
will be supported. Using that approach, credentials can be propagated
along with a message and independent of the underlying transport
protocols. Similarly, confidentiality and integrity of a message can be
ensured using message level protection. Message level security support
would help address end-to-end security requirements so that requests can
traverse through multiple network layers, topologies and intermediaries
in a secure fashion independent of the underlying protocol.

In the future, it is also anticipated that in order for client
applications to determine the level of security expected by a Web
service and the expected type of credential, the information about the
authentication policy will be included in or available through the
service definition (WSDL). Based on that service definition, a client
provides appropriate credentials. If the container has policies for the
service, then they must be referenced and used.

* Figure 11 security flow overview

image:11.png[image,width=382,height=216]

Consider a scenario where incoming SOAP/WSDL messages flow over HTTP(S).
The figure above provides a simple overview of the security flow.
Enterprise Web sites rely on the Java EE Server support for the
authentication models. The site also relies on a Proxy Server’s support
for security. In these scenarios, authentication occurs before the Java
EE Server receives the request. In these cases, a Proxy Server or Web
Server forwards authentication credentials into the Java EE Application
Server. The Java EE application server handles the request similar to
how it handles other HTTP requests.

Two forms of authentication are available for use within Web Services
for Java EE based on existing Java EE functionality. These are HTTP
BASIC-AUTH and Symmetric HTTP, which are defined by the Servlet
specification.

Using the authentication models above, the container can also perform a
credential mapping of incoming credentials at any point along the
execution path. The mapping converts the external user credentials into
a credential used within a specific security domain, for example by
using Kerberos or other imbedded third party model.

In addition to Java EE security model for credential propagation, it may
be beneficial to carry identity information within SOAP message itself
(e.g., as a SOAP header). This can help address situations where Web
services need to be supported where inherent security support of
underlying transport and protocols may not be sufficient (e.g., JMS).
JSR109 does not require any support for credential propagation within
SOAP messages and considers this functionality as future work.

==== Authorization

In an enterprise security model, each application server and middleware
element performs authorization for its resources (EJBs, Servlets,
Queues, Tables, etc.). The Java EE authentication/delegation model
ensures that the user identity is available when requests are processed
.

On successful authentication, identity of the authenticated user is
associated with the request. Based on the identity of the user,
authorization decisions are made. This is performed by the Java EE
Servers based on the Java EE security model to only allow authorized
access to the methods of EJBs and Servlets/JSPs. Authorization to Web
services implemented as JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Endpoints will be
based on the servlet/JSP security model.

==== Integrity and Confidentiality

In general, integrity and confidentiality are based on existing Java EE
support such as HTTPS.

Message senders may also want to ensure that a message or parts of a
message remain confidential and that it is not modified during transit.
When a message requires confidentiality, the sender of the message may
encrypt those portions of the message that are to be kept private using
XML Encryption. When the integrity of a message is required to be
guaranteed, the sender of the message may use XML Digital Signature to
ensure that the message is not modified during transit. This
specification recommends that Java EE servers use XML Encryption for
confidentiality, and XML Digital Signature for integrity but defers to
future work to standardize the format and APIs.

==== Audit

Java EE Servers can optionally write implicit and explicit audit records
when processing requests. The middleware flows the user credentials and
a correlation ID in an implicit context on all operations. Management
tools can gather the multiple logs, merge them and use the correlation
information to see all records emitted processing an incoming Web
service request. It is recommended that Java EE servers implement
support for audit records, but defers to the Java EE to standardize the
record formats and APIs to support audit logs.

==== Non-Repudiation

The combination of Basic Authentication over HTTP/S is widely used in
the industry today to ensure confidentiality, authentication and
integrity. However, it fails to assure non-repudiation.

It is recommended that Java EE servers implement support for
non-repudiation logging, but does not define a standard mechanism to
define and support it.

=== [#anchor-79]##Goals

The security model for Web services in Java EE application servers
should be simple to design and use, ubiquitous, cost effective, based on
open standards, extensible, and flexible. The base functionality needs
to be able to be used for the construction of a wide variety of security
models, security authentication credentials, multiple trust domains and
multiple encryption technologies. Therefore, the goals for security
include the following:

* Should support protecting Web services using Java EE authorization
model.
* Should support propagating authentication information over the
protocol binding through which a Web service request is submitted.
* Should support transport level security to ensure confidentiality and
integrity of a message request.
* Should be firewall friendly; be able to traverse firewalls without
requiring the invention of special protocols.

==== Assumptions

The following assumptions apply to this chapter:

The server relies on the security infrastructure of the Java EE
Application Server.

The Quality of Service (QoS) of a secure Web service container is based
on the QoS requirements and functionality of the underlying Java EE
application server itself (e.g., integrity).

The server relies on HTTPS and RMI-IIOP over SSL for hop-by-hop
confidentiality and integrity .

=== [#anchor-80]##Specification

The following sections define the requirements for implementing security
for Web Services for Java EE.

==== Authentication

There are few authentication models to authenticate message senders that
are adopted or proposed as standards. Form based login requires html
processing capability so it is not included in this list. Web Services
for Java EE product providers must support the following:

* BASIC-AUTH: Java EE servers support basic auth information in the HTTP
header that carries the SOAP request. The Java EE server must be able to
verify the user ID and password using the authentication mechanism
specific to the server. Typically, user ID and password are
authenticated against a user registry. To ensure confidentiality of the
password information, the user ID and password are sent over an SSL
connection (i.e., HTTPS). See the Servlet specification for details on
how BASIC-AUTH must be supported by Java EE servers and how a HTTP
Digest authentication can be optionally supported. Client container
specification of authentication data is described by the Java EE
specification section 3.4.4. The EJB and web containers must support
deploy time configuration of credential information to use for Web
services requests using BASIC-AUTH. Also, these containers must provide
a way to configure each instance of the generated static stub or dynamic
proxy implementation with credential information. The means for this is
provider specific though it is typically handled using the generated
static stub or dynamic proxy implementation.
* Symmetric HTTPS: Java EE servers currently support authentication
through symmetric SSL, when both the requestor and the server can
authenticate each other using digital certificates. For the HTTP clients
(i.e., SOAP/HTTP), the model is based on the Servlet specification.

==== Authorization

Web Services for Java EE relies on the authorization support provided by
the Java EE containers and is described in the Java EE specification
section 3.5.

JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Endpoint authorization must be defined using
the http-method element value of POST.

====  Integrity and Confidentiality

A Web Services for Java EE server provider must support HTTPS for
hop-by-hop confidentiality and integrity. The WSDL port address may use
https: to specify the client requirements.

[#anchor-81]##Appendix A.Relationship to other Java Standards

Java APIs for XML

The only required API from this list is JAX-RPC, JAX-WS, JSR-181 and
JSR-250. The rest are listed as being of potential interest. These APIs
may become required in a future specification.

JAX-M (JSR 00067) focuses on XML messaging and the Java language.

JAX-R (JSR 00093) defines the Java interfaces to XML registries, like
JNDI, ebXML and UDDI. These interfaces provide the mechanism through
which client applications find Web services and Web services (and
servers) publish their interfaces.

JAX-P (JSR 00005 and 00063) defines APIs for parsing XML

JAX-RPC (JSR 00101) focuses on XML RPC and the Java language, including
representing XML based interface definitions in Java, Java definitions
in XML based interface definition languages (e.g. SOAP) and marshalling.

JAX-WS (JSR 224) is a follow-on to JAX-RPC and extends it.

JSR-181 defines Web Services Metadata using annotations to simplify the
programming model for Web Services

JSR-250 defines Common Annotations for the Java Platform

XML Trust (JSR00104) defines APIs and protocol for a “Trust Service” to
minimize the complexity required for using XML Signatures.

XML Digital Signature (JSR 00105) defines the APIs for XML digital
signature services.

XML Digital Encryption (JSR 00106) defines the APIs for encrypting XML
fragments.

Java APIs for WSDL (JSR00110) defines the APIs for manipulating WSDL
documents.

Java EE APIs

Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 defines the programming model for implementing
Web services which run in the EJB container.

Servlet 2.5 defines the packaging and container service model for
implementing Web services which run in the servlet container.

Appendix B.Optional support for J2EE 1.3 platforms

Web Services for J2EE Version 1.1 does not require support for
applications built according to the Web Services for J2EE Version 1.0
specification. A vendor may optionally support Web Services for J2EE 1.0
by implementing that version of the specification. See the Web Services
Version 1.0 Change Log for more details on the differences between the
two specifications.
