/**
 * A Web service endpoint.
 *
 * <p>Endpoints are created using the static methods defined in this
 * class. An endpoint is always tied to one {@code Binding}
 * and one implementor, both set at endpoint creation time.
 *
 * <p>An endpoint is either in a published or an unpublished state.
 * The {@code publish} methods can be used to start publishing
 * an endpoint, at which point it starts accepting incoming requests.
 * Conversely, the {@code stop} method can be used to stop
 * accepting incoming requests and take the endpoint down.
 * Once stopped, an endpoint cannot be published again.
 *
 * <p>An {@code Executor} may be set on the endpoint in order
 * to gain better control over the threads used to dispatch incoming
 * requests. For instance, thread pooling with certain parameters
 * can be enabled by creating a {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} and
 * registering it with the endpoint.
 *
 * <p>Handler chains can be set using the contained {@code Binding}.
 *
 * <p>An endpoint may have a list of metadata documents, such as WSDL
 * and XMLSchema documents, bound to it. At publishing time, the
 * Jakarta XML Web Services implementation will try to reuse as much of that metadata
 * as possible instead of generating new ones based on the annotations
 * present on the implementor.
