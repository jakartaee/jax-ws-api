/**
 * This class defines web service permissions.
 * <p>
 * Web service Permissions are identified by name (also referred to as
 * a "target name") alone. There are no actions associated
 * with them.
 * <p>
 * The following permission target name is defined:
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>publishEndpoint
 * </dl>
 * The {@code publishEndpoint} permission allows publishing a
 * web service endpoint using the {@code publish} methods
 * defined by the {@code jakarta.xml.ws.Endpoint} class.
 * <p>
 * Granting {@code publishEndpoint} allows the application to be
 * exposed as a network service. Depending on the security of the runtime and
 * the security of the application, this may introduce a security hole that
 * is remotely exploitable.
