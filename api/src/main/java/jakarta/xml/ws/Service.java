/**
 * {@code Service} objects provide the client view of a Web service.
 * <p>{@code Service} acts as a factory of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Proxies for a target service endpoint.</li>
 * <li>Instances of {@link jakarta.xml.ws.Dispatch} for
 *     dynamic message-oriented invocation of a remote
 *     operation.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The ports available on a service can be enumerated using the
 * {@code getPorts} method. Alternatively, you can pass a
 * service endpoint interface to the unary {@code getPort} method
 * and let the runtime select a compatible port.
 *
 * <p>Handler chains for all the objects created by a {@code Service}
 * can be set by means of a {@code HandlerResolver}.
 *
 * <p>An {@code Executor} may be set on the service in order
 * to gain better control over the threads used to dispatch asynchronous
 * callbacks. For instance, thread pooling with certain parameters
 * can be enabled by creating a {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} and
 * registering it with the service.
