     * binding (and a port) and configuring the dispatch accordingly from
     * the WSDL associated with this {@code Service} instance or
     * from the metadata from the {@code endpointReference}.
     * If this {@code Service} instance has a WSDL and
     * the {@code endpointReference}

     * MUST be used.
